This award, adjudicated by an independent committee of experts, is an opportunity to underline work that is exceptional in scope, contribution and relevance to sociology in Ireland and to the discipline more broadly. For a contribution that provides a unique and original perspective that greatly advanced our understanding of food poverty and multiple deprivations in Ireland, we proudly celebrate the following article:"

This issue includes four insightful articles that engage with different empirical and theoretical traditions and point to the breadth and depth of the discipline. Our first article, written by Benoı̂t Laplante, Teresa Castro-Mart ın, Clara Cortina and Ana Fostik, considers the trajectory of family formation in Ireland. Considering a post-Catholic landscape, the authors offer strong empirically driven evidence that Ireland is emerging as a very differently patterned landscape. Both how/when families are formed and how they arrange themselves later in the lifecourse are considered. The second article, by John Hall, interrogates and develops a typology of the grammar of social theory. Offering the remarkable claim that there are only three basic sets of assumptions about human social life in modern times, the work ambitiously develops an argument to reveal the basic grammar of how social theory is developed and used. The third provides an in-depth view of social values and civic behaviour among the youth of Ireland. Doing one of the things that sociology does best, Charlotte Silke, Bernadine Brady, Ciara Boylan and Pat Dolan offer an interpretative layer that accounts for social context. This work seeks to understand the inter-play of group-level dynamics and meso-level influences. Finally, Kenjiro Sakakibara reveals the notable variation in the intersection of disability and work exclusion as revealed in the 2011 Irish Census. An engaging use"

Prompted by a recent reversal of this trend, this paper explores gender differences in participation in higher education in 27 OECD countries between 1971 and 2015. While increased participation by women was thought to be part of the solution to persistent gender inequalities we argue that this is not an inevitable outcome. Our argument is based on an analysis of changes in the gender composition of the student population, using available secondary data. We explore how changing gender differentials are linked to the concurrent massification of HE, changing distribution of enrolments by field of study, changes in sex segregation by field, features of national education systems and wider social structural differences related to gender. Our analysis examines the complex interaction between discipline-specific levels of sex segregation and overall levels of gender parity. We argue that that sex segregation needs to be considered alongside women’s long-standing higher participation rates to understand why the latter has not triggered a transformation in the gendered division of labour."

The aim of this case study was to explore the case for a mentored mentoring continuum when compared with the usual dyadic or group mentoring approaches.  This study was conducted through mentoring, discussion and development of ideas with a group of four people working in Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland, during 2017: a mentoring guide, senior mentor, mentor also acting as mentee and second mentee.  Nine structured meetings were held, which included both an agreed agenda and a recording of minutes, and which were reviewed and agreed by mentors/mentees.  Informal and unstructured meetings were also held throughout the period. Meetings were mentee and mentor driven, variously.  The case study consisted of an exploration of the aspects of a mentored mentoring continuum that was reported to have facilitated enhanced and continuous professional and personal development in all participants.  A comparison of this proposed method with the traditional dyadic model of mentoring is presented.  We contend that there is increased support for mentors and mentees within the mentored mentoring model, that the potential for learning is greater than with the dyadic model.  We suggest that mentor training is vital, and that while mentoring may be time-consuming, we agree with the findings of others that the mentors benefit as much from mentoring relationships as do the mentees."

The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences and perspectives of community members involved in a university– community partnership that developed a social justice and alternative placement program for Bachelor of Education students enrolled at a Southern Ontario University. Despite being formed with the best of intentions, authentic university-community partnerships are complex entities and are often very difficult to achieve. This study looks at the important benefits as well as significant challenges for the community partners, and how the complexity of the universitycommunity partnership grows with the numbers of partners involved (multiple community partners in the case of my research). The experiences of the community partners are expressed through the interviews I conducted with participants. In my study, as in the case of many practitioner research studies, uncovering important knowledge about social and political issues starts from the local (community partner) perspective. This research study is meant to be a possible guide for those who wish to undertake similar work. It is my intention that the research"
ea2890d074bfd55fcde5dc81ef94b31f278fc26c,"In 2004 Wright et al. issued a challenge to sociologists, to examine ‘the effect of the structure of the academy on teaching and learning outcomes’ (2004: 155). In this paper I take up this challenge, beginning with a short overview of the changing Irish higher education context, highlighting three macro level changes that currently impact on teaching sociology in Ireland. I argue that such a structural lens is essential to our understanding of the meso (institutional and disciplinary) levels of teaching sociology. I argue a nascent ‘teaching and learning movement’ in Irish sociology may be emerging. A number of factors that have facilitated this are identified. However even a quick glance at Irish higher education also reveals contradictions and conflicts which threaten this movement before it is even established, including worsening staff-student ratios, increased casualisation of teaching and the neo-liberal turn. The paper concludes with a call for more sociologically informed work both on teaching and learning in Irish higher education, and on teaching sociology. This would enable more informed involvement in critical debates around teaching excellence at the national and institutional levels. It would also make public pedagogies currently in use for teaching sociology in Ireland."

The authors use Scott and Lyman’s (1968) concept of accounts to explore absence sociologically. Drawing on data generated via focus groups, an open-ended questionnaire, and an online survey with students, we outline the different excuses and justifications for missing classes used by students and present their understanding of attendance at classes as an optional feature of student life. Individual students’ attendance differed across courses, throwing doubt on the usefulness of individual-level frameworks for understanding attendance. We argue that decisions to attend are influenced by a variety of contextual issues, including knowledge of legitimate accounts for the setting, pedagogic approaches in use, and students’ perceptions of the usefulness of classes. We conclude that to counter the trend of declining attendance and enhance student learning, it is important to better understand how both local norms, values, curriculum design, and assessment practices combine to facilitate students’ absences. Focusing on accounts allows us to better understand student absence rather than accepting this as an inevitable feature of contemporary student behavior about which nothing much can be done."

There have also been changes in gender roles and gender role attitudes over the period. This review will present sociological research analysing this major social change, including research that places the Irish case in a comparative European and international context. The review will mirror the main foci of the field, paying particular attention to research on gender role attitudes, occupational segregation and unpaid work. The gendering of the Irish workforce has been a complex and uneven process, involving continuities as well as changes. Overall, the sexual division of labour remains a key feature of paid and unpaid work in Ireland, and the concept has considerable explanatory power in relation to persistent gender inequalities."

36c571c48c2103caa0819022357fe66ab738f9d6,"This article reports on an Irish study that examines the teaching of large, introductory-level sociology courses at a research-intensive university. The study’s aim was to ameliorate some of the problems associated with large classes by applying key lessons from the U.S. literature to an Irish setting. Overall, the initiative was successful; attendance improved, student evaluations were positive, and the numbers of students continuing with sociology increased. The study illustrates that these lessons can be applied successfully in countries with a broadly similar sociology curriculum and suggests that there is scope to extend what Howard (2010) calls “the teaching and learning movement in sociology” beyond the United States. The results indicate that simple changes lead to gains in student learning. There is therefore a value in sociologists exploring the transferability of other techniques that may be applicable to the Irish classroom."

We then move on to discuss the fi ndings of two small qualitative audience studies, offering some insights into the way listening is woven into people’s daily routines and its meaning for their imaginative lives and sense of self. The advantages of, and the case for more qualitative research on radio audiences are outlined. There is a lot of work still to be done in this area and many questions left unanswered. We still know too little about how radio audiences understand the medium i.e. what audiences do with radio. Studies of the experience of listening to the BBC radio drama and an Irish talk show provide an insight into this largely unexplored area of radio research. Listeners to both genres were found to belong to the active audience. Similarities and differences in modes of listening and levels of engagement will be outlined. Following"

This is an aspect of participation on talk radio shows that has been largely neglected by previous studies. Callers have concerns about how they manage their self-presentation on-air. They are aware of both the host and the listening audience, and try to control the impression they ‘give off’. Callers to The Gerry Ryan Show are central players who, together with the host and the production team, contribute to the staging of debate in this on-air forum. Concerns about performance were found to be secondary for those who rang the show with a problem. These callers tended to prioritize instrumental goals such as problem-solving or support-seeking."

Results of a survey show “women family managers” enjoy increased status, job security and flexibility. Many are able to take advantage of this flexibility to combine child rearing and career roles. “Non‐family women managers” perceive themselves as competitive and independent people, they have better academic qualifications and are less likely to be married and have children. However, both groups are unenthusiastic about their training, mentors and personal contacts and consider that career progress is easier for men. In general, all women managers feel they lack power and opportunities to make progress."

Using high-frequency panel data from the country designed to follow single women and men into marriage, we examine the extent to which premarital fertility is associated with the timing of marriage. Two notable findings emerge. First, premarital fertility typically leads to a more rapid transition into marriage, compared to not having had a premarital conception or birth, and this effect is as strong for men as it is for women. Second, among women with premarital fertility, those who are wealthier, and those who have two parents alive, have lower odds of not marrying. Among men with premarital fertility, however, no patterns predict their subsequent marital outcomes. This study contributes to the literature on fertility and marriage in sub-Saharan Africa by including men in the analysis."

These behaviors, which define the transition from adolescence to adulthood, have long-term implications for well-being and directly affect a person’s risk of contracting HIV. Using an experimental design embedded in a panel survey from Malawi, this study assesses how HIV voluntary counseling and testing of young adults affects these decisions. The results show a negligible intent-to-treat effect of HIV testing on behaviors. There is some suggestive evidence, however, of a differential response by wealth and by prior beliefs about one’s HIV status."

1e464db49faa5b8c2f703b783ab84c64c50b5991,"HIV/AIDS is drastically changing the demographic landscape in high-prevalence countries in Africa. The prime-age adult population bears the majority of the mortality burden, and these “missing” prime-age adults have implications for the socioeconomic well-being of surviving family members. This study uses a 13-year panel from Tanzania to examine the impacts of prime-age mortality on the time use and health outcomes of older adults, with a focus on long-run impacts and gender dimensions. Prime-age deaths are weakly associated with increases in working hours of older women when the deceased adult was coresident in the household. The association is strongest when the deceased adult was living with the elderly individual at the time of death and for deaths in the distant past, suggesting that shorter-run studies may not capture the full extent of the consequences of adult mortality for survivors. Holding more assets seems to buffer older adults from having to work more after these shocks. Most health indicators are not worse for older adults when a prime-age household member has died, although more distant adult deaths are associated with an increased probability of acute illness for the surviving elderly. For deaths of children who were not residing with their parents at baseline, the findings show no impact on hours worked or health outcomes."

Two main questions are investigated: What are the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of migration? and How do schooling, first marriage, and work relate to migration patterns? The study uses panel data collected from a survey designed specifically to explore socioeconomic and demographic aspects of youths’ transitions to adulthood. Respondents were tracked when they moved. Moves are not uncommon, and the predominant reasons for moves are noneconomic. Although historically ethnic traditions in this area have held that girls and women usually do not move upon marrying, young women are now more likely to move than young men, with marriage being a main reason for doing so. Closer ties to the head of the household are associated with less movement for both women and men."
f88b8d687ef0f5decec3cbe4262e4afcdb7b9b54,"This article examines the relationship between female schooling and two behaviors— cumulative fertility and contraceptive use—in fourteen Sub-Saharan African countries where Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have been conducted since the mid-1980s. Average levels of schooling among women of reproductive age are very low, from less than two years to six. Controlling for background variables, the last years of female primary schooling have a negative relation with fertility in about half the countries, while secondary schooling is associated with substantially lower fertility in all countries. Female schooling has a positive relationship with contraceptive use at all levels. Among ever-married women, husband's schooling exerts a smaller effect than does female schooling on contraceptive use and, in almost all cases, on fertility. Although the results suggest commonalities among these Sub-Saharan countries, they also reveal intriguing international differences in the impact of female schooling, which migh..."

Using data from the 2005 Albania Living Standards Measurement Survey, models are estimated by parametric and semi-parametric methods to account for the effect of observable and unobservable characteristics that could affect individual smoking decisions and earnings. Information on the smoking behaviour of parents is used to address the endogeneity of the smoking decision. The results show that, after controlling for observed individual characteristics and parental education and taking into account unobserved heterogeneity in personal characteristics, smoking is found to have a substantial negative impact on earnings. The main results are robust to a range of alternative specifications. On average, smokers’ earnings are 19–23 percent lower than the earnings of similar non-smokers."

However, widespread variation exists in how labor statistics are collected in household surveys. This paper analyzes the effects of alternative survey design on employment statistics by implementing a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania. Two features of the survey design are assessed – the level of detail of the employment questions and the type of respondent. It turns out that both features have relevant and statistically significant effects on employment statistics. Using a short labor module without screening questions induces many individuals to adopt a broad definition of employment, incorrectly including domestic duties. But after reclassifying those in domestic work as ‘not working’ in order to obtain the correct ILO classification, the short module turns out to generate lower female employment rates, higher working hours for both men and women who are employed, and lower rates of wage employment than th..."

Survey respondents undoubtedly hold diverse ideas about what it means to be""poor""or""rich.""Further, this heterogeneity may be correlated with other characteristics, including welfare, leading to frame-of-reference bias. To test for this bias, vignettes were added to a nationally representative survey of Tajikistan, in which survey respondents rank the economic status of the theoretical vignette households, as well as their own. The vignette rankings are used to reveal the respondent's own scale. The findings indicate that respondents hold diverse scales in assessing their welfare, but that there is little bias in either the economic gradient of subjective welfare or most other coefficients on covariates of interest. These results provide a firmer foundation for standard survey methods and regression specifications for subjective welfare data."
ee9294eeb2ae1456f4c29cf47bb34666681d5cf9,"Despite the importance of agriculture to economic development, and a vast accompanying literature on the subject, little research has been done on the quality of the underlying data. Due to survey logistics, agricultural data is usually collected by asking respondents to recall the details of events occurring during past agricultural seasons that took place a number of months prior to the interview. This gap can lead to recall bias in reported data on agricultural activities. The problem is further complicated when interviews are conducted over the course of several months, thus leading to recall of variable length. To test for such recall bias, the number of months between harvest and interview is examined for three African countries with respect to several common agricultural input and harvest measures. The analysis shows little evidence of a bias impacting data quality. There is some indication that more salient events are less subject to recall decay. Overall, the results allay some concerns about the data quality of some types of agricultural data collected through recall over lengthy periods; but, further research in different contexts is needed."
8f615d50f02b6a3a6103579b50f23b5024318845,"This paper exploits a unique longitudinal data set from Tanzania to examine the consequences of child labor on education, employment choices, and marital status over a 10-year horizon. Shocks to crop production and rainfall are used as instrumental variables for child labor. For boys, the findings show that a one-standard-deviation (5.7 hour) increase in child labor leads 10 years later to a loss of approximately one year of schooling and to a substantial increase in the likelihood of farming and of marrying at a younger age. Strikingly, there are no significant effects on education for girls, but there is a significant increase in the likelihood of marrying young. The findings also show that crop shocks lead to an increase in agricultural work for boys and instead lead to an increase in chore hours for girls. The results are consistent with education being a lower priority for girls and/or with chores causing less disruption for education than agricultural work. The increased chore hours could also account for the results on marriage for girls."

On top of health and education outcomes adult mortality can have significant effects on children by influencing demographic outcomes including the timing of marriage. This paper examines marriage outcomes for a sample of children interviewed in Tanzania in the early 1990s and re-interviewed in 2004. We find that while girls who became paternal orphans married at significantly younger ages orphanhood had little effect on boys.

On top of health and education outcomes, adult mortality can have significant effects on children by influencing demographic outcomes including the timing of marriage. This paper examines marriage outcomes for a sample of children interviewed in Tanzania in the early 1990s and re-interviewed in 2004. We find that while girls who became paternal orphans married at significantly younger ages, orphanhood had little effect on boys. On the other hand, non-parental deaths in the household affect the timing of marriage for boys."

We study a sample of 718 nonorphaned children surveyed in 1991-94, who were traced and reinterviewed as adults in 2004. A large proportion, 19 percent, lost one or more parents before the age of 15 in this period, allowing us to assess permanent health and education impacts of orphanhood. In the analysis, we can control for a wide range of child and adult characteristics before orphanhood, as well as community fixed effects. We find that maternal orphanhood has a permanent adverse impact of 2 cm of final height attainment and one year of educational attainment. Expressing welfare in terms of consumption expenditure, the result is a gap of 8.5 percent compared to similar children whose mother survived till at least their 15 birthday."

It is based on a random sample of households residing in 13 of the nation’s 26 provinces in 1993. These 13 provinces include about 83% of the population of Indonesia as of 1993. The survey collects data on individual respondents, their families, their households, the communities in which they live, and the health and education facilities they use. The IFLS data are unique in several ways, including the panel nature of the data, the depth of the questionnaires, and the collection of data from the communities in which households reside. The availability of facility data among the information collected from communities is the focus of this paper. The first wave (IFLS1 in 1993) was conducted on individuals living in 7,224 households (Frankenberg and Karoly, 1995). The IFLS2 sought to re-interview the same respondents four years later, including tracking respondents who had migrated from their 1993 (IFLS1) dwelling. This includes efforts to follow individuals who moved out of their previous household, such as young adult children moving away from parents. In the IFLS2, about 7,500 households were interviewed (Frankenberg and Thomas, 2000). 2 The IFLS3, was fielded in 2000 and resulted in a sample of over 10,000 households, again reflecting the protocol of tracking respondents who have split from the original households and formed new households (Strauss et al., 2004a). The IFLS contains a wealth of information collected at the individual and household level, including multiple indicators of economic well-being (consumption, income, and assets); education, migration, and labor market outcomes; marriage, fertility, and contraceptive use; health status, use of health care, and health insurance; relationships among coresident and non-coresident family members; processes underlying household decision-making; transfers among family members and inter-generational mobility; and participation in community activities. By simultaneously collecting data on a wide range of topics (as in the Living Standard Measurement Study surveys), the IFLS allows analyses of interrelated issues not possible in other single-purpose surveys. The data allows researchers to study the effects of 1 We thank Sumeet Bhatti for excellent research assistance."

Despite improvements during that time there remain areas which require further investigation and clarification. This study was designed to provide more detailed data on critical issues identified but not fully covered in ILO factory monitoring reports that are of particular concern to women workers. The results of the survey should enable better policy and program responses on these issues to improve the well-being of women workers whilst improving productivity and quality. The study consisted of a survey designed to explore workers and managers knowledge attitudes and practices around a number of issues: health and nutrition breastfeeding and childcare personal security harassment including sexual harassment and workplace relations and dispute resolution. The survey instruments were designed following a series of Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) discussion sessions with workers and HR/admin managers. Following the survey the results of the survey were presented and discussed to obtain more detail and clarification in focus group discussions with workers and managers. A total of 981 workers and 80 HR/admin managers participated in the surveys. The key findings from the survey were presented at a consultative workshop attended by over 80 Cambodian and foreign representatives of unions factories employer organisations government NGOs and international organisations. The participants made several recommendations based on the main research findings which raise additional issues for policy and program development. (excerpt)

At the same time, for most of the year, there is substantial underemployment, especially in rural areas. It could therefore be argued that seasonality in the demand for labor is leading to both underemployment and labor shortages. This paper provides basic descriptive data from a 2004 nationally representative household survey to assess the typical workload of the population. The data confirm the presence of strong seasonality effects in the supply of labor, as well as substantial differences in workload between men and women due to the burden of domestic work, including the time spent for collecting water and wood."

Using data from the 2005 Albania Living Standards Monitoring Survey, they jointly estimate a system of three equations: the smoking decision and two separate wage equations for smokers and nonsmokers. The results show that, after controlling for observed characteristics and taking into account unobserved heterogeneity in personal characteristics, smoking has a substantial negative impact on wages. On average smokers' wages are 20 percent lower than the wages of similar nonsmokers, providing strong evidence for the potential policy relevance of tobacco control initiatives for developing countries."

We construct a measure of gender inequality based on economic status, which is different than other measures of gender inequality considered in the literature (such as intimate partner violence or sexual relationship power scales). Using a unique combination of data sets for our analysis – Kenya Demographic Health Survey (2003), Kenya Population Census (1998), and a poverty map of Kenya at the sub-location level – we estimate gender inequality between young women and older men at the sub-location level. We find that gender inequality in the sub-location has a strong and positive correlation with an individual’s likelihood of being HIV positive, conditional on a set of individual and community characteristics. The effects are stronger for females and in Western Kenya. Conditional on inequality, poverty of young women in the sub-location is either uncorrelated with an individual’s HIV status or negatively correlated. We also find significant correlations between an individual’s HIV status and his/her age, sex, education, schooling status, ethnicity, and household assets. The results contribute to our understanding of the socioeconomic determinants of the spread of HIV/AIDS and may have important implications for prevention policies. 1 The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of the World Bank or its member countries.

b96dc3f6966351f36148fb8e562dc477ad6f6c85,Research on the socioeconomic impact of AIDS is wide and varied and can be partitioned into estimates of macroeconomic costs and analysis of household (microeconomic) impacts. Most of the empirical analysis of the economic impact of high prime-age adult mortality due to HIV/AIDS and other fatal illnesses has been at the macroeconomic level with mixed conclusions. The underpinnings of the macroeconomic studies are the behaviors of individuals affected by HIV/AIDS those who are infected or those with socio-economic ties to infected persons. While there is increasing evidence of short-run economic impacts due shocks such as large-scale fiscal crises morbidity shocks and weather variation evidence about the impact of HIV/AIDS is often largely anecdotal or sometimes simply speculative. Furthermore the available evidence relates to the impact of HIV/AIDS in the short-run and not in the long-run. If households have short-run coping strategies (such as selling off assets borrowing increased remittances from relatives) that are not sustainable in the long-run the true impact of these shocks may be quite different from the short-run outcomes. Long-run impacts could evolve if this shock results in changes in income or asset strategies such as taking less risk holding more liquid and less productive assets or less investment due to lower access to credit.

Improving the health and nutrition of schoolchildren through school-based programs is not a new concept. School health programs are ubiquitous in high-income countries and most middle-income countries. In low-income countries, these programs were a common feature of early, particularly colonial, education systems, where they could be characterized as heavily focused on clinical diagnosis and treatment and on elite schools in urban centers. This situation is changing as new policies and partnerships are being formulated to help ensure that programs focus on promoting health and improving the educational outcomes of children, as well as being socially progressive and specifically targeting the poor, girls, and other disadvantaged children. This evolution reflects five key changes in our understanding of the role of these programs in child development."

b86038d43e6a6ad58e2c79386513afd2a210007d,"Mortality of parents and other adults due to the African AIDS epidemic could reduce children's primary schooling by reducing households' ability to pay fees, raising the opportunity cost of children's time, and leaving orphaned children with guardians who care less about their education than would their parents. This study measures the impact of adult deaths and orphan status on primary school attendance and hours spent at school using a panel household survey from north-western Tanzania, an area hard-hit by the AIDS epidemic. Attendance was delayed for maternal orphans and children in poor households with a recent adult death; there was no evidence that children 7-14 dropped out of primary school due to orphan status or adult deaths. However, among children already attending, school hours were significantly lower in the months prior to an adult death in the household and seemed to recover following the death. In addition, girls sharply reduced their hours in school immediately after losing a parent. Improvements in school quality and better access to secondary education would improve outcomes for all children, including those affected by adult AIDS mortality. Beyond that, public policy needs to focus on the special schooling constraints faced by children affected by adult deaths, both in terms of increased opportunity costs of their time and the psychological impacts, with an eye to how they might be mitigated and at what cost."

This effect more than fully offsets the foregone earnings due to reduced schooling, particularly for girls. We find no significant effects of child labour on several indicators of health. This evidence in part accounts for why child labour is such a pervasive phenomenon and suggests that the case against child labour requires both future increases in the returns to schooling (i.e., beyond the five year horizon encompassed by our data set) and that parents are able to borrow (or internally fund) the investment in schooling."

Using panel data from Tanzania, we find that households respond to transitory income shocks by increasing child labor, but that the extent to which child labor is used as a buffer is lower when households have access to credit. These findings contribute to the empirical literature on the permanent income hypothesis by showing that credit-constrained households actively use child labor to smooth their income. Moreover, they highlight a potentially important determinant of child labor and, as a result, a mechanism that can be used to tackle it."

Analysis of farm and chore hours across demographic groups generally found small and insignificant changes in labor supply of individuals in households experiencing a prime‐age adult death. While some farm activities are temporarily scaled back and wage employment falls after a male death, households did not shift cultivation toward subsistence food farming and did not appear to have reduced their diversification over income sources more than 6 months after a death."

High adult mortality threatens to reverse hard-won gains in raising school enrollments, and, the loss of a parent could reduce a child's chances of starting, continuing, or completing school, affecting his or her long-term productivity, earning capacity, health, and well-being. There is imperative need in understanding these impacts, which children are most affected, and which policy instruments will have the greatest impact on encouraging orphans to enter school, particularly important in countries like Tanzania, where overall enrollment rates are low, and resources are scarce. This study measures the impact of adult death, and parent's survival on primary school enrollment of children in northwestern Tanzania, where the HIV infection rates among adults as of the 90s, ranged from less than one percent, to more than twenty percent. Based on descriptive, and multivariate analyses of a longitudinal survey, the study finds that households are coping with adult deaths, by delaying enrollment in primary school, though maintaining older children's enrollment, especially so among children in poor households."

Holding household resources constant, a woman's control over economic resources affects the couple's decision-making. Compared with a woman with no assets that she perceives as being her own, a woman with some share of household assets influences reproductive health decisions. Evidence suggests that her influence on service use also varies if a woman is better educated than her husband, comes from a background of higher social status than her husband's, or if her father is better educated than her father-in-law. Therefore, both economic and social dimensions of the distribution of power between spouses influence use of services, and conceptualizing power as multidimensional is useful for understanding couples' behavior."

Controlling for background variables, the last years of female primary schooling have a negative relation with fertility in about half the countries, while secondary schooling is associated with substantially lower fertility in all countries.

Among ever-married women, husband's schooling exerts a smaller effect than doe's female schooling on contraceptive use and, in almost all cases, on fertility. Although the results suggest commonalities among these Sub-Saharan countries, they also reveal intriguing international differences in the impact of female schooling, which might reflect differences in the quality of schooling, labor markets, and family planning programs, among others."

The countries are Tanzania Uganda Burundi Mali Niger Nigeria Kenya Ghana Togo Zambia Zimbabwe Senegal Cameroon and Botswana. Each DHS sample is comprised of 3000-9000 women aged 15-49 years. The researchers were able to control for background variables such as age area of residence wealth and ethnic and religious affiliations but not for the availability of contraceptive services and levels of child mortality. A negative correlation was found between female schooling and fertility in almost all countries although the relationship is non-linear. Female primary schooling has a negative relation with fertility in about half of the countries and no relation in the other half. Secondary schooling is universally associated with lower fertility and the strength of the effect increases with the years of schooling. The authors note no major differences between countries in different income groups but point to evidence of a positive relationship between income and fertility in Nigeria and a negative relationship in Tanzania Ghana Togo and Botswana. Among ever-married women husbands schooling has no significant relation with fertility in about one-third of the countries and when both womens and mens schooling matter womens schooling exerts a much larger negative effect upon fertility than mens schooling. For both fertility and contraceptive use there are large differences across countries which have not been explained. Botswana Kenya and Zimbabwe have met with significant success in lowering fertility and raising contraceptive use. These three countries have the highest levels of female schooling the lowest child mortality rates and the most vigorous family planning programs.

Adjuvant anti-PD1 treatment improves relapse-free survival (RFS) but has not been shown to improve overall survival (OS) in melanoma and is associated with risks of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), some permanent. We identified factors patients consider in deciding whether to undergo adjuvant anti-PD1 treatment and assessed prospective health-related quality of life (HRQoL), treatment satisfaction, and decisional regret.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients with stage IIIB-IV cutaneous melanoma and free of disease, were candidates for adjuvant anti-PD1 immunotherapy, and had not yet discussed adjuvant treatment options with their oncologist were eligible. Participants viewed a 4-minute informational video tailored to their disease stage which communicated comprehensive, quantitative information about the risk of relapse both with and without adjuvant treatment, and risks of each irAE before deciding whether or not to opt for adjuvant therapy. We collected data on demographics, HRQoL, and attitudes toward adjuvant treatment over 1 year.


RESULTS
14/34 patients (41%) opted for adjuvant anti-PD1 immunotherapy, 20/34 (59%) opted for observation. Patients choosing adjuvant immunotherapy scored higher on HRQoL social well-being at pre-treatment, were more likely to endorse positive statements about adjuvant immunotherapy, and to perceive that their physician preferred adjuvant therapy. They had lower decisional regret and higher satisfaction, even if they experienced toxicity or recurrence.


CONCLUSIONS
When provided with comprehensive quantitative information about risks and benefits of adjuvant anti-PD1 immunotherapy, 20/34 (59%) of patients opted for observation. Patients choosing adjuvant immunotherapy had lower decisional regret and higher satisfaction over time even if they had poorer outcomes in treatment."

 Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) with anti- programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein (CTLA)-4 have had immense success in cancer treatment. However, primary and acquired resistance to these therapies limits their clinical benefit. Accumulating evidence indicates that chemotherapeutic agents such as Cyclophosphamide (CTX) that can induce anticancer immunity stand out as particularly promising partners for use in combination with ICBs. A combination approach to reorchestrate the anti-tumor immune response could magnify the clinical benefit of ICBs. CTX is an alkylating chemotherapeutic which is directly tumoricidal that can also modulate immune cells. CTX is known to preferentially deplete certain T cell subsets (such as T regulatory cells, T regs) and lead to homeostatic proliferation of antigen-specific T cells in addition to the modulation of myeloid cells. Here, we hypothesized that the addition of ICBs will augment the immunomodulatory changes induced by CTX including but not limited to the homeostatic proliferation of T cells which will reset the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire to favor tumor antigen-specific T cells. The murine melanoma tumor model, B16-F10, is known to be refractory to treatment with ICBs, particularly anti-PD-1, as these only modestly slow the growth of small tumors. Here, we show that a single dose of CTX one day prior to starting an ICB (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) regimen slows tumor progression of B16-F10 compared to CTX or ICB alone. Similarly, the triple combination (CTX+ anti- PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4) also significantly prolongs the survival of tumor bearing mice. Further, the combination of CTX with anti- PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 increased the number of activated and proliferating CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This increase in cytotoxic T cells was accompanied by a decrease in Tregs, which further augments the tumor control. Additionally, we also observed a significant increase in a highly cytolytic population of CD4+ CD8+ double positive TILs. The depletion of CD8+ cells but not CD4+ cells abrogates the therapeutic effect of the triple combination suggesting that the anti-tumor effect is CD8+ T cell dependent. Overall, our results suggest that the combination of CTX with the ICBs, anti- PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, is a potent combinatorial approach that can prime an anti-tumor response and promote robust control of tumor growth. Thus, these findings form the basis for further investigations in understanding the mechanisms of combinatorial cancer therapies in tumor models that are refractory to ICB therapies and can inform the design of future therapeutic interventions that combine ICB with chemotherapy.

While a number of reports have shown that tumor-reactive TILs express CD39, few reports have demonstrated that conversely, CD39 can be leveraged to serve as a proxy of tumor-reactive CD8 T cells. Using single-cell CITE/RNA/TCRseq, we show that CD39+ CD8 T cells in human lung cancers demonstrate transcriptional and proteomic features of exhaustion, tumor reactivity, and clonal expansion. Moreover, TCR cloning revealed that CD39 enriched for tumor-reactive CD8 T cell clones. Flow cytometry of 440 lung cancer specimens revealed that CD39 level on CD8 T cells is only weakly correlated with tumoral features that currently guide lung cancer therapy, such as histology, driver mutation, PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden. PD-1 axis blockade, but not cytotoxic chemotherapy, increased intratumoral CD39+ CD8 T cells. CD39 correlated with PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells and high pre-treatment/early-on-treatment levels were associated with improved clinical outcomes, but not immune-related adverse events, from immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Here we report sustained efficacy outcomes at 7.5 y. Methods: Patients (pts) with previously untreated, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma were randomly assigned 1:1:1 and stratified by PD-L1 status, BRAF mutation status, and metastasis stage to receive NIVO 1 mg/kg + IPI 3 mg/kg for 4 doses Q3W, followed by NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W (n = 314); NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W + placebo (n = 316); or IPI 3 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses + placebo (n = 315) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and OS with NIVO + IPI or NIVO alone versus IPI. Results: With a minimum follow-up of 7.5 y, median OS remained stable at 72.1 mo (NIVO + IPI), 36.9 mo (NIVO), and 19.9 mo (IPI); median MSS was NR, 49.4 mo, and 21.9 mo, respectively (Table). While the objective response rate remained stable at 58% (NIVO + IPI), 45% (NIVO), and 19% (IPI), median duration of response had now been reached for NIVO at 90.8 mo and remains NR and 19.2 mo for NIVO + IPI and IPI, respectively. Subsequent systemic therapy was received by 36%, 49%, and 66% of NIVO + IPI-, NIVO-, and IPI-treated patients, respectively, and median time to that therapy was NR (95% CI, 45.9–NR), 24.7 mo (16.0–38.7), and 8.0 mo (6.5–8.7). Of patients alive at 7.5 y, 106/138 (77%, NIVO + IPI), 80/115 (70%, NIVO), and 27/60 (45%, IPI) were off treatment and had never received subsequent systemic therapy. No change to the safety summary was observed with additional follow-up; updated health-related quality of life data will be reported. Of the 10 new deaths since the 6.5-y follow-up (ie, 5 NIVO + IPI; 3 NIVO; 2 IPI), none were treatment-related; 4 were due to melanoma progression; 1 was due to an unknown cause; and 5 were due to other causes, but not associated with a COVID diagnosis. Conclusions: The 7.5-y follow-up continues to demonstrate the durability of responses with NIVO + IPI and an ongoing survival plateau. A substantial difference in median OS and MSS between patients treated with NIVO + IPI or NIVO was observed in descriptive analyses. Clinical trial information: NCT04540705. [Table: see text]"

To overcome the sparsity of ctDNA fragments in low tumor fraction (TF) settings and increase MRD sensitivity, we previously leveraged genome-wide mutational integration through plasma whole genome sequencing (WGS). We now introduce MRD-EDGE, a composite machine learning-guided WGS ctDNA single nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) detection platform designed to increase signal enrichment. MRD-EDGE uses deep learning and a ctDNA-specific feature space to increase SNV signal to noise enrichment in WGS by 300X compared to our previous noise suppression platform MRDetect. MRD-EDGE also reduces the degree of aneuploidy needed for ultrasensitive CNV detection through WGS from 1Gb to 200Mb, thereby expanding its applicability to a wider range of solid tumors. We harness the improved performance to track changes in tumor burden in response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer and demonstrate ctDNA shedding in precancerous colorectal adenomas. Finally, the radical signal to noise enrichment in MRD-EDGE enables de novo mutation calling in melanoma without matched tumor, yielding clinically informative TF monitoring for patients on immune checkpoint inhibition."
3790325ff3d60341a1a558ee1ee9af08e7bfae01,"Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced melanoma; however, a proportion of patients do not experience durable clinical benefit with these agents. Findings from a previous study suggested that the use of proton pump inhibitors while receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to worse clinical outcomes. To validate those results, we performed this retrospective analysis using data from three clinical trials involving patients with advanced melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We found that there is not enough evidence to conclude that proton pump inhibitors influence the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Prospective studies are needed to conclusively determine if the use of proton pump inhibitors has any meaningful impact on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced melanoma. Abstract The impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on clinical outcomes with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with metastatic melanoma was previously analyzed in the phase II study, CheckMate 069. This retrospective analysis utilized data from three phase II/III studies of first-line ICI therapy in untreated advanced melanoma: CheckMate 066, 067, and 069. All randomized patients with PPI use ≤ 30 days before initiating study treatment were included in the PPI-use subgroup. Possible associations between baseline PPI use and efficacy were evaluated within each treatment arm of each study using multivariable modeling. Approximately 20% of 1505 randomized patients across the studies reported baseline PPI use. The median follow-up was 52.6–58.5 months. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival analyses provided insufficient evidence of a meaningful association between PPI use and efficacy outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, nivolumab, or ipilimumab therapy. In five of the six ICI treatment arms, 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios or hazard ratios traversed 1. Significant associations were observed in the CheckMate 069 combination arm between PPI use and poorer ORR and PFS. This multivariable analysis found insufficient evidence to support meaningful associations between PPI use and ICI efficacy in patients with advanced melanoma."
4347211979d53f927330d6e2843f3db7a30a6ee4,"Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) sequencing for low-burden cancer monitoring is limited by sparsity of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), the abundance of genomic material within a plasma sample, and pre-analytical error rates due to library preparation, and sequencing errors. Sequencing costs have historically favored the development of deep targeted sequencing approaches for overcoming sparsity in ctDNA detection, but these techniques are limited by the abundance of ccfDNA in samples, which imposes a ceiling on the maximal depth of coverage in targeted panels. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is an orthogonal approach to ctDNA detection that can overcome the low abundance of ccfDNA by supplanting sequencing depth with breadth, integrating signal across the entire tumor mutation landscape. However, the higher cost of WGS limits the practical depth of coverage and hinders broad adoption. Lower sequencing costs may thus allow for enhanced ctDNA cancer monitoring via WGS. We therefore applied emerging lower-cost WGS (Ultima Genomics, 1USD/Gb) to plasma samples at ∼120x coverage. Copy number and single nucleotide variation profiles were comparable between matched Ultima and Illumina datasets, and the deeper WGS coverage enabled ctDNA detection at the parts per million range. We further harnessed these lower sequencing costs to implement duplex error-corrected sequencing at the scale of the entire genome, demonstrating a ∼1,500x decrease in errors in the plasma of patient-derived xenograft mouse models, and error rates of ∼10−7 in patient plasma samples. We leveraged this highly de-noised plasma WGS to undertake cancer monitoring in the more challenging context of resectable melanoma without matched tumor sequencing. In this context, duplex-corrected WGS allowed us to harness known mutational signature patterns for disease monitoring without matched tumors, paving the way for de novo cancer monitoring."

497cba631cf40b65c6acbbe1f0816df757eab2f3,"GITR is a TNF receptor, and its activation promotes immune responses and drives antitumor activity. The receptor is activated by the GITR ligand (GITRL), which is believed to cluster receptors into a high-order array. Immunotherapeutic agonist antibodies also activate the receptor, but their mechanisms are not well characterized. We solved the structure of full-length mouse GITR bound to Fabs from the antibody DTA-1. The receptor is a dimer, and each subunit binds one Fab in an orientation suggesting that the antibody clusters receptors. Binding experiments with purified proteins show that DTA-1 IgG and GITRL both drive extensive clustering of GITR. Functional data reveal that DTA-1 and the anti-human GITR antibody TRX518 activate GITR in their IgG forms but not as Fabs. Thus, the divalent character of the IgG agonists confers an ability to mimic GITRL and cluster and activate GITR. These findings will inform the clinical development of this class of antibodies for immuno-oncology."

This pilot study investigated ONCOS-102 (oncolytic adenovirus expressing GM-CSF) plus anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (PD)-1 therapy in anti–PD-1–resistant melanoma. Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced melanoma progressing after prior PD-1 blockade received intratumoral ONCOS-102 either as priming with 3 doses (3 × 1011 viral particles) during Week 1 [Part 1 (sequential treatment)] or as 4-dose priming and 8 booster doses every 3 weeks [Part 2 (combination treatment)]. From Week 3, all patients received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (≤8 doses). The primary endpoint was safety. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival, and immunologic activation in repeat biopsies were also investigated. Results: In 21 patients (Part 1, n = 9; Part 2, n = 12) ONCOS-102 plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated: most adverse events (AE) were mild/moderate in severity. Pyrexia (43%), chills (43%), and nausea (28%) were the most common ONCOS-102–related AEs. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. ORR was 35% [response evaluation in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, irRECIST]. Reduction in size of ≥1 non-injected lesions observed in 53% patients indicated a systemic effect. In injected tumors, persistent immune-related gene expression and T-cell infiltration were associated with clinical benefit. Viral persistence and efficacy in injected and non-injected lesions without additional toxicity supported Part 2 dosing regimen in future studies. Conclusions: ONCOS-102 plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated and led to objective responses in patients with anti–PD-1–resistant advanced melanoma. ONCOS-102 promoted T-cell infiltration, particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which persisted at Week 9, driving clinical benefit. Further investigation of ONCOS-102 plus PD-1 blockade is warranted.

 Despite the significant success of immunotherapy, more than 40% of cancer patients remain unresponsive or exhibit an insufficient response. Well-designed combinations of targeted therapy and immunotherapy have the potential to increase effectiveness of cancer treatment and overcome the absence of response to either therapy alone. Since targeted therapies that enhance tumor antigenicity can enhance the effectiveness of immune based therapies, we have built a compendium of in vitro and in vivo assays to evaluate the effect of multiple immunogenic drugs. In these assays, we use the preclinical melanoma cell line B16-F10 model as it is highly metastatic and responds poorly to immunotherapy alone. The tumor suppressor p53 is a key target both in terms of targeted therapy owing to its role in halting tumor progression as well as in combination with immunotherapy, since p53 has varied roles in immune modulation. APR-246 can activate p53 and elicit some p53-independent effects in various tumor models predominantly through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. Since these cellular stressors (including p53) have been shown to be capable of rendering tumor cells immunogenic, we hypothesized that APR-246 may also increase the antigenicity of tumor cells. Indeed, we observed that treatment of B16 cells with APR-246 increases their MHC expression. Additionally, in our in vitro co-culture assays, cells treated with APR-246 were able to activate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells either directly or via CD11c+ cells. We also observed that mice immunized with APR-246-treated B16 cells and then implanted with healthy untreated melanoma cells, were able to confer prolonged tumor free survival. Taken together, we believe that APR-246 has the potential to make for a strong combination with immunomodulatory therapies owing to its immunogenic potential. Based on these observations, we rationally designed a combination treatment regimen that would further enhance the immunogenic effects elicited by APR-246 on tumor cells. The triple combination of APR-246 with the TLR4 agonist, Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and the anti-CD40 antibody significantly reduced the growth of B16 tumor in C57BL/6J mice. Strikingly, using CRISPR generated B16 p53 KO cells, we have discovered that these effects of APR-246 exist even in the absence of p53, albeit slightly reduced. Therefore, our results indicate that combination of APR-246 with immunomodulatory agents may be effective in treating cancers irrespective of their genetic status of p53. Our finding suggests that drugs with immunogenic potential, in addition to their original therapeutic indication, such as APR-246 are good candidates for the improvement of various clinically relevant immune modulatory therapies.

Little prospective data exist to guide the choice of either initial therapy or treatment sequence in this population. This study was conducted to determine which initial treatment or treatment sequence produced the best efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a phase III trial, patients with treatment-naive BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive either combination nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm A) or dabrafenib/trametinib (arm B) in step 1, and at disease progression were enrolled in step 2 to receive the alternate therapy, dabrafenib/trametinib (arm C) or nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm D). The primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were 3-year OS, objective response rate, response duration, progression-free survival, crossover feasibility, and safety. RESULTS A total of 265 patients were enrolled, with 73 going onto step 2 (27 in arm C and 46 in arm D). The study was stopped early by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee because of a clinically significant end point being achieved. The 2-year OS for those starting on arm A was 71.8% (95% CI, 62.5 to 79.1) and arm B 51.5% (95% CI, 41.7 to 60.4; log-rank P = .010). Step 1 progression-free survival favored arm A (P = .054). Objective response rates were arm A: 46.0%; arm B: 43.0%; arm C: 47.8%; and arm D: 29.6%. Median duration of response was not reached for arm A and 12.7 months for arm B (P < .001). Crossover occurred in 52% of patients with documented disease progression. Grade ≥ 3 toxicities occurred with similar frequency between arms, and regimen toxicity profiles were as anticipated. CONCLUSION Combination nivolumab/ipilimumab followed by BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy, if necessary, should be the preferred treatment sequence for a large majority of patients."

 Multiple suppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are capable of blunting anti-tumor T cell responses. These include engagement of inhibitory receptors expressed in tumor-associated, exhausted CD8 T cells, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), 2B4 (also known as CD244), and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). While immune checkpoint blockade therapies aimed at reversing the dysfunctional state of tumor-associated T cells have demonstrated clinical effectiveness, not all cancer patients achieve long-term disease control. This is due, at least in part, to the refractory nature of what are categorized as terminally exhausted CD8 T cells to be reinvigorated by, for example, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. As CD8 T cell exhaustion (or dysfunction) is a major therapeutic challenge, gaps in our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell exhaustion (or dysfunction) program in cancer warrant further study of pathways that program T cells toward exhaustion (or dysfunction). Through comprehensive immune profiling of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), we found that CD47 expression in CD8 TILs isolated from melanoma patients significantly correlates with expression of several checkpoint inhibitory molecules (e.g., TIM-3, PD-1 and LAG-3). Additionally, our re-analysis of single cell data from melanoma patients revealed that terminally exhausted T cells (Tex) and TCF7hi Tex precursor cells exhibit high levels of CD47 transcripts, suggesting phenotypic association of CD47 with T cell exhaustion. We confirmed our observations in murine B16-F10 melanoma where CD47 expression is significantly upregulated in exhausted CD8 TILs. We also show that CD47 functions as a negative regulator for T cell proliferation and function during T cell priming. To address the role of CD47 during the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion/dysfunction in cancer, we performed adoptive T cell transfer of the naïve-sorted Cd47+/+ (WT) and Cd47+/- (Het) antigen specific Pmel-1 CD8 T cells (but not Cd47-deficient Pmel-1 CD8 T cells as they would be subject to innate immune clearance) into B16 tumor-bearing mice and found that Cd47-Het Pmel-1 CD8 TILs, as compared to the Cd47-WT Pmel-1 CD8 TILs, exhibit less expression of exhaustion-related genes (e.g. Pdcd1, Lag3 and Tox), and increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation and proliferation (e.g. Mki67, Lck, Cd69, Gzma, Gzmk). We further confirmed that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as an extracellular matrix protein and a ligand of CD47, contributes to driving the differentiation of CD8 T cells toward exhaustion. Our data highlight for the first time the potential of extracellular matrix protein TSP-1 in programming CD8 T cell exhaustion in cancer through its interaction with CD47 expressed on CD8 T cells.

Until recently, little prospective data existed to guide the choice of initial therapy or sequence. Results of the DREAMseq Trial showed that the treatment sequence beginning with nivolumab/ipilimumab (Nivo/Ipi) immunotherapy produced a clinically meaningful 20% improvement in 2-year overall survival (OS) compared to the sequence beginning with dabrafenib/trametinib (Dab/Tram) targeted therapy. The OS and progression-free survival (PFS) curves were biphasic crossing at 10 and 6 months, respectively. Our aim is to characterize QOL trends within and between the initial therapies through 24 weeks (wks). Methods: 265 pts were randomly assigned to Nivo/Ipi for up to 12 wks then Nivo alone (Arm A) or Dab/Tram continuously (Arm B) and at disease progression (PD) received the alternate therapy. QOL was assessed by the PROMIS Profile 29 at baseline, wk 12 (end of cycle (C) 2), and wk 24 (end of C4). Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to examine changes over time within treatment arms. OS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method to compare between pts who stopped treatment for toxicity on Arm A by C2 and who continued on Arm A therapy to C4. A complete case analysis compared QOL domain means for (C2) vs. (C4). Pt-reported adverse events were also collected. Results: Baseline completion rates for the PROMIS-29 for Arm A (n = 108, 81.2%) and Arm B (n = 117, 88.6%) and decreased to 28.6% and 53.8%, respectively at C4. Through C4, the principal reasons for dropout were toxicity (35.2% for Arm A and 11.9% for Arm B) and PD (26.1% for Arm A and 18.6% for Arm B). From Baseline to C2: Arm B reported statistically significant improvements in Pain Interference (-3.45, P = 0.007), Sleep (-2.11, P = 0.014), and Anxiety (-3.74, P < 0.001). By C4, these early differences had dissipated (mean diff. = 0.73 – 1.73, all p = NS). For pts remaining on treatment to C4 (n = 157), a complete case analysis indicates no significant QOL differences between C2 vs C4. Pts stopping for toxicity on Arm A after C2 had similar 2-yr OS to pts who continued on Arm A to C4. QOL at C2 (Arm A: stopping for toxicity vs. on treatment) were meaningful, but underpowered (Physical Health (PH) mean difference = -3.5, p = 0.18). Conclusions: Over the first 12 wks, Dab/Tram is associated with significant improvement in overall function and less disturbance in in sleep, pain, physical function, and PH than Nivo/Ipi as expected by PFS curves and toxicity profiles. These differences dissipate by 24 wks when Arm A therapy has switched to Nivo alone and PFS curves cross. Early QOL and treatment cessation due to Nivo/Ipi toxicity was not associated with differences in 2-yr OS. Clinical trial information: NCT02224781."

 Canonical p53-activated pathways can influence a microenvironment that promotes antitumor immune surveillance via tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We examined whether p53 activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) influences antitumor immunity and show that p53 signaling induced pharmacologically with APR-246 (eprenetapopt) can augment the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical models, a strategy that is also being tested in patients (NCT04383938). We first investigated the effects of combining APR-246 with ICB in wildtype C57BL6 (B6) mice bearing syngeneic p53 wildtype MC38 colon cancer and B16 melanoma tumors. The combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody (RMP1-14) with APR-246 in mice significantly delayed tumor growth (p < 0.001) and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice, compared to monotherapies (p < 0.01). To further dissect the effects of APR-246 on myeloid and T cells in the TME, we used a conditional knockout of p53 in CSF1R+myeloid cells (CSF1Rcre/p53fl mice), or T cells (CD8cre/p53fl mice). CSF1Rcre/p53fl had loss of tumor control and worse survival with APR-246+anti-PD-1. CD8cre/p53fl had intact tumor control. To study enhanced p53 activity in the TME, we performed flow cytometry, cytokine multiplex and global transcriptional profiling by RNA seq. We found enhanced p53-activity led to increased infiltration of T cells, increased MHC-II expression in TAMs and downregulation of M2-associated cytokines. This was associated with cellular senescence in TAMs and induction of canonical p53-induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our preclinical findings informed the development of a phase I/II clinical trial using APR-246 with pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04383938). We studied peripheral blood samples from two of the patients with tumor regression and two patients in whom tumors progressed on therapy. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum prior to therapy, and at the beginning of cycle 2 and 5 for the patients with tumor control, and at the end of therapy for patients who had progression. Single cell RNA-seq of PBMCs demonstrated a signature consistent with T cell activation and proliferation, and SASP-associated changes in the myeloid compartment as seen in mice. T cell profiling of PBMCs by flow cytometry demonstrated strong proliferation of T cells in patients with tumor control. Serum cytokine analysis demonstrated robust in IL-12, IFN-gamma and Eotaxin-1 in the two responders, which was not seen in the patients whose tumors progressed. Our study illustrates p53-induced SASP in TAMs as a mechanism to reprogram the TME and augment responses to ICB. Ongoing studies will help determine biomarkers that are predictive of response to APR-246+ICB therapy.

Despite dramatic and sometimes durable responses to therapy, most patients (pts) either (i) do not respond to therapy (intrinsic resistance), or (ii) subsequently progress after initial clinical benefit (acquired resistance). Currently, insights into the molecular mechanisms of resistance to ICIs in NSCLC are lacking. Methods: To investigate clinical and molecular features of pts progressing on ICIs, we identified pts who underwent repeat tumor biopsies on and/or after disease progression on ICIs and were included in the Stand Up 2 Cancer (SU2C)/Mark Foundation multi-institutional cohort. Biopsy specimens underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq). Results: We identified 37 pts who underwent a total of 47 repeat biopsies on or after ICIs. Six pts underwent multiple post-ICI biopsies (range 2-4). Twenty-five pts (68%) received PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy, 6 (16%) received PD-(L)1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors, and 6 (16%) received other PD-1 inhibitor-based combinations. Overall, the objective response rate was 46% among pts undergoing repeat biopsies (complete response 2 [5%], partial response 15 [41%], stable disease 14 [38%], progressive disease 5 [14%] and not evaluable 1 [3%]). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.1 months. In total, pre-ICI biopsy specimens were available in 20 pts. WES and RNAseq were performed on 67 and 44 specimens, respectively. Median tumor mutation burden (TMB) in pre-ICI specimens was 5.0 mutations/Mb versus 4.9 mutations/Mb in post-ICI specimens ( p= 0.3, Mann-Whitney U test). Among 20 paired pre/post-ICI specimens, there was no significant difference in TMB (pre-treatment median 3.9 mutations/Mb; post-treatment median 4.3 mutations/Mb; p= 0.7, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). One pt with a complete response acquired a nonsense mutation in B2M, and one pt with a partial response acquired a nonsense mutation in JAK1. Among 10 paired pre/post-ICI specimens that underwent RNAseq, we observed significant decreases in granzyme B and perforin in post-ICI specimens ( p= 4×10-5 and p= 2×10-3, respectively, limma-voom analysis). Conclusions: Genomic alterations impairing antigen presentation (e.g., B2M) or immune activation (e.g., JAK1) may enable resistance to ICIs in a small subset of cases. However, the majority of repeat biopsies obtained from pts progressing on ICIs lacked clear genetic mediators of resistance, suggesting the presence of additional tumor-intrinsic and/or tumor-extrinsic factors underlying resistance to ICIs in NSCLC."

This open-label, phase I study (TRX518-003) evaluated the safety and efficacy of repeated dose TRX518 monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab in advanced solid tumors. Patients and Methods: TRX518 monotherapy was dose escalated (Part A) and expanded (Part B) up to 4 mg/kg loading, 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Parts C–E included dose-escalation (2 and 4 mg/kg loading followed by 1 mg/kg) and dose-expansion (4 mg/kg loading) phases with gemcitabine (Part C), pembrolizumab (Part D), or nivolumab (Part E). Primary endpoints included incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), serious adverse events (SAE), and pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints were efficacy and pharmacodynamics. Results: A total of 109 patients received TRX518: 43 (Parts A+B), 30 (Part C), 26 (Part D), and 10 (Part E), respectively. A total of 67% of patients in Parts D+E had received prior anti–PD(L)1 or anti–CTLA-4. No DLTs, treatment-related SAEs, and/or grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed with TRX518 monotherapy. In Parts C–E, no DLTs were observed, although TRX518-related SAEs were reported in 3.3% (Part C) and 10.0% (Part E), respectively. Objective response rate was 3.2%, 3.8%, 4%, and 12.5% in Parts A+B, C, D, and E, respectively. TRX518 affected peripheral and intratumoral regulatory T cells (Treg) with different kinetics depending on the combination regimen. Responses with TRX518 monotherapy+anti–PD1 combination were associated with intratumoral Treg reductions and CD8 increases and activation after treatment. Conclusions: TRX518 showed an acceptable safety profile with pharmacodynamic activity. Repeated dose TRX518 monotherapy and in combination resulted in limited clinical responses associated with immune activation. See related commentary by Hernandez-Guerrero and Moreno, p. 3905"
d8a44c9625a909a8394c6b0ad51a7b5eae225bae,"Simple Summary Uveal melanoma is a rare subtype of malignant melanoma. It is known to rapidly metastasize, with the liver being the most frequently affected organ. Due to differences from melanoma arising in the skin, such as a lower number of mutations, it responds poorly to immune checkpoint blockade, a treatment approach reinvigorating the patient’s immune system to eliminate the cancer. We here investigated the safety and tolerability of a new combination treatment consisting of two established immunotherapy medications (ipilimumab and nivolumab) with the addition of an experimental arginine depleting medication, pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20), which is thought to make uveal melanoma more amenable to immunotherapy. This novel treatment approach was found to be safe and well-tolerated but did not improve the clinical outcome beyond the expected limited efficacy of approved immunotherapy alone. Abstract Metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) remains challenging to treat, with objective response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) being much lower than in primary cutaneous melanoma (CM). Besides a lower mutational burden, the overall immune-excluded tumor microenvironment of UM might contribute to the poor response rate. We therefore aimed at targeting deficiency in argininosuccinate synthase 1, which is a key metabolic feature of UM. This study aims at investigating the safety and tolerability of a triple combination consisting of ipilimumab and nivolumab immunotherapy and the metabolic therapy, ADI-PEG 20. Nine patients were enrolled in this pilot study. The combination therapy was safe and tolerable with an absence of immune-related adverse events (irAE) of special interest, but with four of nine patients experiencing a CTCAE grade 3 AE. No objective responses were observed. All except one patient developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA) within a month of the treatment initiation and therefore did not maintain arginine depletion. Further, an IFNg-dependent inflammatory signature was observed in metastatic lesions in patients pre-treated with ICB compared with patients with no pretreatment. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated variable presence of tumor infiltrating CD8 lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression at the baseline in metastases."

e4bcb5d3b61ee016acc5f4bfd5cc67af3336d37a,"The majority of JAK2V617F-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have disease-initiating frameshift mutations in calreticulin (CALR), resulting in a common carboxyl-terminal mutant fragment (CALRMUT), representing an attractive source of neoantigens for cancer vaccines. However, studies have shown that CALRMUT-specific T cells are rare in patients with CALRMUT MPN for unknown reasons. We examined class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) allele frequencies in patients with CALRMUT MPN from two independent cohorts. We observed that MHC-I alleles that present CALRMUT neoepitopes with high affinity are underrepresented in patients with CALRMUT MPN. We speculated that this was due to an increased chance of immune-mediated tumor rejection by individuals expressing one of these MHC-I alleles such that the disease never clinically manifested. As a consequence of this MHC-I allele restriction, we reasoned that patients with CALRMUT MPN would not efficiently respond to a CALRMUT fragment cancer vaccine but would when immunized with a modified CALRMUT heteroclitic peptide vaccine approach. We found that heteroclitic CALRMUT peptides specifically designed for the MHC-I alleles of patients with CALRMUT MPN efficiently elicited a CALRMUT cross-reactive CD8+ T cell response in human peripheral blood samples but not to the matched weakly immunogenic CALRMUT native peptides. We corroborated this effect in vivo in mice and observed that C57BL/6J mice can mount a CD8+ T cell response to the CALRMUT fragment upon immunization with a CALRMUT heteroclitic, but not native, peptide. Together, our data emphasize the therapeutic potential of heteroclitic peptide–based cancer vaccines in patients with CALRMUT MPN. Description A heteroclitic CALRMUT peptide cancer vaccine strategy counters MHC-I skewing in patients with MPN. Producing peptides to activate T cells against MPN Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) that have frameshift mutations in calreticulin (CALR) rarely have T cells that target this neoantigen. Gigoux et al. investigated the lack of these T cells by examining class I major histocompatiblity complex (MHC-I) allele frequencies in these patients. They saw a skewing of these alleles and thus developed a heteroclitic peptide vaccine to activate T cells against these tumors. They saw a response in patient samples ex vivo and in mice to immunization with this peptide, which represents a promising treatment for patients with this disease."
eb824b6a2ee0a7d62b1a89742f451cc90a059a91,"Novel strategies to reprogram tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells for cancer immunotherapy are urgently needed, given that the primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has hindered the overall success of immunotherapy. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated, non-replicative vaccinia virus and an approved vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. Here we report rational engineering of recombinant MVA, MQ833, by removing three immune suppressive genes, E5R, E3L, and WR199, from the MVA genome and inserting three transgenes encoding Flt3L, OX40L, and IL-12. Intratumoral (IT) delivery of MQ833 generates potent antitumor responses dependent on CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and M1-like macrophages, the nucleic acid-sensing pathways mediated by MDA5/STING, and interferon feedback loop. IT MQ833 promotes the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes into the injected tumors, depletion of M2-like macrophages, and expansion of M1-like macrophages, generating potent antitumor immunity against tumors resistant to ICB."
f8093363184dc44064f80eed29785d5ffaae0841,"In addition to playing a major role in tumor cell biology, p53 generates a microenvironment that promotes antitumor immune surveillance via tumor-associated macrophages. We examined whether increasing p53 signaling in the tumor microenvironment influences antitumor T cell immunity. Our findings indicate that increased p53 signaling induced either pharmacologically with APR-246 (eprenetapopt) or in p53-overexpressing transgenic mice can disinhibit antitumor T cell immunity and augment the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. We demonstrated that increased p53 expression in tumor-associated macrophages induces canonical p53-associated functions such as senescence and activation of a p53-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This was linked with decreased expression of proteins associated with M2 polarization by tumor-associated macrophages. Our preclinical data led to the development of a clinical trial in patients with solid tumors combining APR-246 with pembrolizumab. Biospecimens from select patients participating in this ongoing trial showed that there was a suppression of M2-polarized myeloid cells and increase in T cell proliferation with therapy in those who responded to the therapy. Our findings, based on both genetic and a small molecule–based pharmacological approach, suggest that increasing p53 expression in tumor-associated macrophages reprograms the tumor microenvironment to augment the response to immune checkpoint blockade."

04301cbea4a460fde8923125788cf13e21d161b8,"Peripheral blood LAG+CD8+ T cells are more commonly identified in immunotherapy-treated patients with cancer who have less favorable outcomes. Pinpointing checkpoint response Immune checkpoint inhibitors can aid the immune system of some to effectively attack tumors, but identifying those patients for whom they will be effective is still a challenge. Arora et al. investigated the abundances of different types of immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer who had better or worse outcomes after immunotherapy treatment. They found that a LAG-3+CD8+ T cell population correlated with poorer outcome after immune checkpoint blockade treatment in a cohort of patients with melanoma and in an independent cohort treated for urothelial carcinoma, suggesting a potential way to identify patients who will respond to checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoint blocking antibodies are a cornerstone in cancer treatment; however, they benefit only a subset of patients and biomarkers to guide immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment choices are lacking. We designed this study to identify blood-based correlates of clinical outcome in ICB-treated patients. We performed immune profiling of 188 ICB-treated patients with melanoma using multiparametric flow cytometry to characterize immune cells in pretreatment peripheral blood. A supervised statistical learning approach was applied to a discovery cohort to classify phenotypes and determine their association with survival and treatment response. We identified three distinct immune phenotypes (immunotypes), defined in part by the presence of a LAG-3+CD8+ T cell population. Patients with melanoma with a LAG+ immunotype had poorer outcomes after ICB with a median survival of 22.2 months compared to 75.8 months for those with the LAG− immunotype (P = 0.031). An independent cohort of 94 ICB-treated patients with urothelial carcinoma was used for validation where LAG+ immunotype was significantly associated with response (P = 0.007), survival (P < 0.001), and progression-free survival (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression and stratified analyses further showed that the LAG+ immunotype was an independent marker of outcome when compared to known clinical prognostic markers and previously described markers for the clinical activity of ICB, PD-L1, and tumor mutation burden. The pretreatment peripheral blood LAG+ immunotype detects patients who are less likely to benefit from ICB and suggests a strategy for identifying actionable immune targets for further investigation."
0a4e18c8c27bf61f4665fb4d156564b878c638fe,"356154 Background: Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) blocking PD-1 and CTLA-4 or BRAF/MEK inhibitors have both shown significant antitumor efficacy and overall survival (OS) benefit in patients (pts) with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma (MM), leading to broad regulatory approval. Little prospective data exists to guide the choice of one over the other as initial therapy or the preferred treatment sequence in this population. The DREAMseq Trial was designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the sequence of nivolumab/ipilimumab (N/I) followed by dabrafenib/trametinib (D/T) to the converse sequence. Methods: Eligible pts with treatment-naive BRAFV600-mutant MM were stratified by ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 and LDH level and randomized 1:1 to receive Step 1 with either N/I (Arm A) or D/T (Arm B) and at disease progression (PD) were enrolled in Step 2 receiving the alternate therapy, D/T (Arm C) or N/I (Arm D), respectively. Pts received N (1mg/kg)/I (3 mg/kg) q3 wks x 4 doses followed by N 240 IV q2 wks for up to 72 wks (Arms A and D) or D 150 mg po BID and T 2 mg po qD until PD (Arms B and C). In 2019, investigators were given the option to use alternate induction dosing of N (3mg/kg)/I (1 mg/kg) q3 wks x 4 doses for Arms A and D. Cycles were every 6 wks and imaging was obtained at baseline and q12 wks on each arm. Primary endpoint was 2-year OS. At the 4th Interim Analysis with 59% of pts being 2 yrs from enrollment, the DSMC and NCI CTEP recommended halting accrual and releasing the data. Results: Beginning 7/2015, 265 out of a proposed 300 pts were enrolled (133 Arm A and 132 Arm B). Median age was 61 (25-85) and 63% were male. Demographics for Arm A and B were balanced with 67% PS 0 and 60% with normal LDH. As of 7/16/21, at a median follow-up of 27.7 mos, 27 pts had switched to Arm C and 46 to Arm D. Overall Grade 3+ toxicity was 60% in Arm A and 52% in Arm B. Grade 5 treatment-related AEs included 2 on Arm A and 1 on Arm C. ORR to date is: Arm A 46% (52/113), Arm B 43% (49/114), Arm C 48% (11/23) and Arm D 30% (8/27). 37/42 assessed pts in Arm A and 19/37 in Arm B remain in response. Median DOR: Arm A- Not reached; Arm B-12.7 mos (95% CI: 8.2, -) (p <0.001). There were 100 deaths (Arm A to C- 38/Arm B to D- 62). 2-yr OS rate for those starting with Arm A was 72% (95% CI: 62-81%) and for Arm B 52% (95% CI: 42-62%) (log-rank p= 0.0095). PFS showed a trend in favor of Arm A (log-rank p=0.054). Both the PFS and OS curves show a biphasic pattern with Arm B being above Arm A until 6 and 10 mos, respectively. For the 115 pts with documented progression on Step 1 (Arm A-44/Arm B-71), 60 (52%) had registered for Step 2. The principal reason for not enrolling on Step 2 was death from PD within 6 mos (Arm A:15/23; Arm B: 25/32). Conclusions: For pts with advanced BRAFV600-mutant MM, the treatment sequence beginning with the CPI combination of N/I resulted in superior OS, which became evident at 10 mos, with longer Step 1 DOR and more ongoing responses than the treatment sequence beginning with D/T. Clinical trial information: NCT02224781."

While five-year survival rates have been reported for patients treated with ICB on clinical trials, little is known about the clinical characteristics, survival past five years, and patterns of late relapse of long-term survivors. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering for unresectable stage III/IV melanoma who survived at least five years following their first dose of ICB (N = 151). Demographics, disease characteristics, and nature of progression were examined. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from 5 years post-ICB. Time to Treatment failure (TTF) was calculated conditionally from 5 years out until next therapy, progression, or death. Results: Of the 151 long-term survivors, median age at first ICB treatment was 62 years (range 22-83), with 101 (66.9%) male and 50 (33.1%) female patients. Stage at first ICB treatment was unresectable stage III (26, 17.2%), M1a (21,13.9%), M1b (39, 25.8%), M1c (52, 34.4%), M1d (13, 8.6%). Melanoma subtype was cutaneous (122, 80.8%), unknown primary (24, 15.9%), mucosal (3, 2%), and acral (2, 1.3%). First ICB was ipi (108, 71.5%), PD-1 (nivo or pembro) (5, 3.3%), and nivo+ipi (37, 24.5%). The best overall response to first ICB was CR (76, 50.3%), PR (27, 17.9%), SD (16, 10.6%) and PD (32, 21.2%). Of the patients who progressed after initial ICB, 38 received subsequent systemic treatment as follows: PD-(L)1 in 20 (53%), BRAF ± MEK in 9 (23.7%), ipi in 7 (18.4%), and chemotherapy in 2 (5.3%). Median duration of follow-up among survivors (N = 138) was 93 months (range 60-192). From 5 years post-ICB, 85% (95% CI: 73-92%) survived an additional 5 years. In those who made it to 5 years without treatment failure (N = 72), the probability of remaining failure-free was 92% (95% CI: 86-99%) at 7 years. Of the 151 patients, only 4 patients (2.6%) experienced disease progression after 5 years. Three patients had radiographic or pathologic disease progression in the lymph nodes and one in the subcutaneous tissue. No patients progressed in the lungs, visceral organs, or CNS after 5 years. At time of analysis, 13 (8.6%) patients died after 5 years post ICB, none died of progressive melanoma. 6 patients died of unknown causes, 2 died of other causes, and 5 died of other non-melanoma cancer-related causes. Conclusions: Patients who survive five years after their initial immunotherapy have excellent overall survival and treatment failure-free survival. Given the anxiety surrounding survivorship and late progression, long-term survivors should be reassured of their excellent prognosis. These data suggest that aggressive follow-up schedules and imaging of melanoma patients after 5 years of survival may not be required."

3d1a5fa65cf8106f26bc9d225a62390c014cb45c,"Targeted immune-based therapies such as adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) are often ineffective because tumors evolve over time and under selective pressure display antigen loss variant clones. A classic example in melanoma is de-differentiation and loss of expression of antigenic proteins. Therapies that activate multiple branches of the immune system may eliminate such escape variantsHere we show that melanoma-specific CD4+ ACT therapy in combination with OX40 co-stimulation or CTLA-4 blockade can eradicate large melanoma tumors with clonal escape variants.Early on-target recognition of melanoma antigens by adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was required. Surprisingly, however, complete tumor eradication was partially dependent on neutrophils. Supporting these findings, extensive neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular traps were found in mouse tumors and in biopsies of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade.Our findings uncover a novel interplay between T cells mediating the initial tumor- and tissue-specific immune response, and neutrophils mediating tumor destruction of antigen loss variants.All tissues were collected at MSKCC following study protocol approval by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board. All mouse procedures were performed in accordance with institutional protocol guidelines at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) under an approved protocol."

However, we show that a cancer vaccine composed of heteroclitic variants of the CALRMUT antigen could overcome this limitation.Approval was obtained for the use of patient-derived specimens and access to clinical data extracted from patient charts by the Institutional Review Boards at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as by the Danish Regional Science Ethics Committee."

The aim of this systematic review was to identify variables linked to whether patients diagnosed with cancer were treated with checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Methods: Using the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework, we conducted a systematic review searching Medline (New PubMed), Embase.com, and the Cochrane Library (Wiley) for papers published in English between January 1, 1997 and July 27, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: 1) primary, peer-reviewed research article; and 2) article reported variables associated with whether patients were treated with checkpoint inhibitors or CAR T-cell therapy. Seven coders independently reviewed titles, abstracts, full texts, and extracted data. The systematic review adhered to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: In total, 5958 titles and abstracts and 134 full texts were screened. Sixteen studies were included in final analyses. All were conducted in the United States using data from national databases (N = 15) or electronic medical records (N = 1). Eleven were cross-sectional, and 5 were cohort studies. Studies looked at melanoma (N = 10), non-small cell lung cancer (N = 3), renal cell carcinoma (N = 2), colorectal cancer (N = 1), prostate cancer (N = 1), and hepatobiliary cancer (N = 1). Studies looked at nivolumab (N = 1), pembrolizumab (N = 1), ipilimumab (N = 1), and sipuleucel-T, (N = 1), and 12 studies did not specify medication names. Treatment facility characteristics (N = 9), geographic location within the United States (N = 1), locale classification (N = 2), distance to treatment facility (N = 2), insurance type (N = 9), age (N = 7), race (N = 5), sex (N = 1), income (N = 4), neighborhood educational attainment (N = 2), comorbidities (N = 6), disease stage (N = 1), metastases (N = 3), clinical trial participation (N = 1), recency of diagnosis (N = 2), other treatments received (N = 3), and lesion characteristics (N = 1) were reported to be associated with whether patients were treated with checkpoint inhibitors or CAR T-cell therapy. Other studies found that insurance type (N = 1), race (N = 3), sex (N = 1), other treatments received (N = 1), and lesion characteristics (N = 1) were not associated with receiving checkpoint inhibitors or CAR T-cell therapy. Conclusions: Findings provide evidence of disparate access to checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapy. More studies are necessary to thoroughly understand how the factors highlighted in our findings intersect to create and maintain disparities in cancer treatment. This level of information is necessary to create interventions that promote equitable access to novel cancer immunotherapies."

Methods: We performed a multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study of patients with IMDC who received SITs following steroids from 2016 to 2020. Patients’ demographic, clinical, and overall survival data were collected and analyzed. 
 
Findings: A total of 184 patients (62 vedolizumab, 94 infliximab, 28 both) were included. The efficacy of achieving clinical remission of IMDC was similar (89% vs 88%, P =0.79) between the two groups. Compared with infliximab group, vedolizumab group had a shorter steroid exposure (35 vs. 50 days, P <0·001), less hospitalizations (16% vs. 28%, P =0·005), and a shorter hospital stay (median 10·5 vs. 13·5 days, P =0·043), but a longer time to clinical response (17.5 vs. 13 days, P =0·012). Longer durations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment (OR 1·01, P =0·004) and steroid use (OR 1·02, P =0·043), and infliximab use alone (OR 2·51, P =0·039) were associated with higher IMDC recurrence. Furthermore, vedolizumab alone ( P =0·027), ≥3 doses of SIT ( P =0·011), and fewer steroid tapering attempts ( P =0·012) were associated with favorable overall survival. 
 
Interpretation: Treatment with vedolizumab as compared to infliximab for IMDC led to comparable IMDC response rates, shorter duration of steroid use and fewer hospitalizations, though with slightly longer time to IMDC response. Vedolizumab treatment also associated with lower rates of cancer progression and better overall survival.

695edc606ea9252cd9ee6a7076de113da36cd315,"Cancer patients have increased morbidity and mortality from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the underlying immune mechanisms are unknown. In a cohort of 100 cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, we found that patients with hematologic cancers had a significantly higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancers after accounting for confounders including ECOG performance status and active cancer status. We performed flow cytometric and serologic analyses of 106 cancer patients and 113 non-cancer controls from two additional cohorts at Penn and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients with solid cancers exhibited an immune phenotype similar to non-cancer patients during acute COVID-19 whereas patients with hematologic cancers had significant impairment of B cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. High dimensional analysis of flow cytometric data revealed 5 distinct immune phenotypes. An immune phenotype characterized by CD8 T cell depletion was associated with a high viral load and the highest mortality of 71%, among all cancer patients. In contrast, despite impaired B cell responses, patients with hematologic cancers and preserved CD8 T cells had a lower viral load and mortality. These data highlight the importance of CD8 T cells in acute COVID-19, particularly in the setting of impaired humoral immunity. Further, depletion of B cells with anti-CD20 therapy resulted in almost complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies, but was not associated with increased mortality compared to other hematologic cancers, when adequate CD8 T cells were present. Finally, higher CD8 T cell counts were associated with improved overall survival in patients with hematologic cancers. Thus, CD8 T cells likely compensate for deficient humoral immunity and influence clinical recovery of COVID-19. These observations have important implications for cancer and COVID-19-directed treatments, immunosuppressive therapies, and for understanding the role of B and T cells in acute COVID-19."

Such imaging probes could be used to predict early response to cancer immunotherapy, help select effective single or combination immunotherapies, and facilitate the development of new immunotherapies or immunotherapy combinations. This study was designed to optimize conditions for performing CD8 PET imaging with 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C and determine whether CD8 PET imaging could provide a safe and effective noninvasive method of visualizing the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 first-in-humans PET imaging study using an anti-CD8 radiolabeled minibody, 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, to detect whole-body and tumor CD8+ leukocyte distribution in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients received 111 MBq of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C followed by serial PET scanning over 5–7 d. A 2-stage design included a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase. Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and semiquantitative evaluation of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake were performed in all patients. Results: Fifteen subjects with metastatic melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. No drug-related adverse events or abnormal laboratory results were noted except for a transient increase in antidrug antibodies in 1 subject. 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C accumulated in tumors and CD8-rich tissues (e.g., spleen, bone marrow, nodes), with maximum uptake at 24–48 h after injection and low background activity in CD8-poor tissues (e.g., muscle and lung). Radiotracer uptake in tumors was noted in 10 of 15 subjects, including 7 of 8 subjects on immunotherapy, 1 of 2 subjects on targeted therapy, and 2 of 5 treatment-naïve subjects. In 3 patients with advanced melanoma or hepatocellular carcinoma on immunotherapy, posttreatment CD8 PET/CT scans demonstrated increased 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in tumor lesions, which correlated with response. Conclusion: CD8 PET imaging with 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C is safe and has the potential to visualize the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes in tumors and reference tissues, and may predict early response to immunotherapy."

Strategies to overcome resistance are promising areas of investigation. Targeting glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor–related protein (GITR) has shown efficacy in preclinical models, but GITR engagement is ineffective in controlling advanced, poorly immunogenic tumors, such as B16 melanoma, and has not yielded benefit in clinical trials. The alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) depletes regulatory T cells (Tregs), expands tumor-specific effector T cells (Teffs) via homeostatic proliferation, and induces immunogenic cell death. GITR agonism has an inhibitory effect on Tregs and activates Teffs. We therefore hypothesized that CTX and GITR agonism would promote effective antitumor immunity. Here we show that the combination of CTX and GITR agonism controlled tumor growth in clinically relevant mouse models. Mechanistically, we show that the combination therapy caused tumor cell death, clonal expansion of highly active CD8+ T cells, and depletion of Tregs by activation-induced cell death. Control of tumor growth was associated with the presence of an expanded population of highly activated, tumor-infiltrating, oligoclonal CD8+ T cells that led to a diminished TCR repertoire. Our studies show that the combination of CTX and GITR agonism is a rational chemoimmunotherapeutic approach that warrants further clinical investigation."

A clinical trial was designed to assess safety, immunogenicity, and clinical responses with IPI + NY-ESO-1 vaccines and effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Patients with measurable NY-ESO-1+ tumors were enrolled among three arms: A) IPI + NY-ESO-1 protein + poly-ICLC (pICLC) + incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA); B) IPI + NY-ESO-1 overlapping long peptides (OLP) + pICLC + IFA; and C) IPI + NY-ESO-1 OLP + pICLC. Clinical responses were assessed by irRC. T cell and Ab responses were assessed by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELIspot and ELISA. Tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment were evaluated for immune infiltrates. Eight patients were enrolled: 5, 2, and 1 in Arms A-C, respectively. There were no DLTs. Best clinical responses were SD (4) and PD (4). T-cell and antibody (Ab) responses to NY-ESO-1 were detected in 6 (75%) and 7 (88%) patients, respectively, and were associated with SD. The breadth of Ab responses was greater for patients with SD than PD (p = .036). For five patients evaluable in the TME, treatment was associated with increases in proliferating (Ki67+) CD8+ T cells and decreases in RORγt+ CD4+ T cells. T cell densities increased for those with SD. Detection of T cell responses to NY-ESO-1 ex vivo in most patients suggests that IPI may have enhanced those responses. Proliferating intratumoral CD8+ T cells increased after vaccination plus IPI suggesting favorable impact of IPI plus NY-ESO-1 vaccines on the TME.

Methods This was a retrospective review of 26 melanoma patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) since 2012 who received reinduction ipi/nivo at least 6 months following completion of an initial course of ipi/nivo. We collected data on demographics, genetics, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), best overall responses (BORs), time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS). Results The BOR rate (complete response+partial response) was 74% (95% CI 52% to 90%) after the first course of ipi/nivo but only 23% (95% CI 8% to 45%)) after reinduction. Response to reinduction did not correlate with response to the initial course. Among the 16 patients who had an objective response to the first course, only four (25%) responded to reinduction. Of five patients who did not respond to the first course, one responded to reinduction. For all patients, median TTF was 5.3 months after reinduction; TTF was shorter for reinduction than for the first course in 85% of patients. Median OS from reinduction was 8.4 months; estimated 2-year OS was 18%. Although reinduction was associated with fewer irAEs than the initial course of ipi/nivo (58% of patients vs 85% of patients in the initial course), eight (31%) patients experienced at least one new irAE after the second course. Conclusions BOR rate and TTF were markedly less favorable after reinduction with ipi/nivo than after the initial course of ipi/nivo. Reinduction ipi/nivo was associated with frequent irAEs although less frequent than for the initial course."
bf4a244f5fc736d99329925c44c99ddcabe448c0,"Purpose: Cutaneous and unknown primary melanomas frequently harbor alterations that activate the MAPK pathway. Whether MAPK driver detection beyond BRAF V600 is clinically relevant in the checkpoint inhibitor era is unknown. Experimental Design: Patients with melanoma were prospectively offered tumor sequencing of 341–468 genes. Oncogenic alterations in 28 RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway genes were used to construct MAPK driver groups. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was determined for patients who received first-line programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monotherapy, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or subsequent genomically matched targeted therapies. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for TTF using driver group and clinical variables. Results: A total of 670 of 696 sequenced melanomas (96%) harbored an oncogenic RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway alteration; 33% had ≥1 driver. Nine driver groups varied by clinical presentation and mutational burden. TTF of PD-1 monotherapy (N = 181) varied by driver, with worse outcomes for NRAS Q61 and BRAF V600 versus NF1 or other alterations (median 4.2, 7.5, 22, and not reached; P < 0.0001). Driver group remained significant, independent of tumor mutational burden and clinical features. TTF did not vary by driver for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (N = 141). Among 172 patients with BRAF V600 wild-type melanoma who progressed on checkpoint blockade, 27 were treated with genomically matched therapy, and eight (30%) derived clinical benefit lasting ≥6 months. Conclusions: Targeted capture multigene sequencing can detect oncogenic RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway alterations in almost all cutaneous and unknown primary melanomas. TTF of PD-1 monotherapy varies by mechanism of ERK activation. Oncogenic kinase fusions can be successfully targeted in immune checkpoint inhibitor–refractory melanoma."

However, one primary concern regarding subunit vaccines is the relatively weak immune responses induced by proteins or peptides. Therefore, developing novel and effective vaccine adjuvants is critical for the success of subunit vaccines. Modified vaccinia virus (MVA) is a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. In this study, we explored the potential of heat-inactivated MVA (heat-iMVA) as a novel vaccine adjuvant. Methods We co-administered heat-iMVA with a model antigen, chicken ovalbumin (OVA), either intramuscularly or subcutaneously twice, two weeks apart, and analyzed anti-OVA specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleens and skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and serum anti-OVA IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies. We also compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with several known vaccine adjuvants, including complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax, an MF59-like preclinical grade nano-emulsion. In addition, we tested whether co-administration of heat-iMVA plus tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells improves antitumor efficacy in a B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination model. Using Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) or Batf3-deficient mice, we evaluated the contribution of the STING pathway and Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8α DCs in heat-iMVA-induced immunity. Results Co-administration of protein- or peptide-based immunogens with heat-iMVA dramatically enhances Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses. This adjuvant effect of heat-iMVA is dependent on the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response requires Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs). Heat-iMVA infection of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) promoted antigen cross-presentation, whereas live MVA infection did not. RNA-seq analyses revealed that heat-iMVA is a more potent activator of the STING pathway than live MVA. Additionally, combining tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells with heat-iMVA delayed tumor growth and extended the median survival in B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination models. Conclusions Heat-iMVA induces type I interferon (IFN) production and antigen cross-presentation via a STING-dependent mechanism in DCs. Co-administration of heat-iMVA with peptide antigen generates strong Th1-biased cellular and humoral immunity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that heat-iMVA is a safe and potent vaccine adjuvant."

Here, we report 6.5-year efficacy and safety outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 314), nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 316), or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses; n = 315). Coprimary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab versus ipilimumab. Secondary end points included objective response rate, descriptive efficacy assessments of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone, and safety. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS; descriptive analysis), which excludes deaths unrelated to melanoma, was also evaluated. RESULTS Median OS (minimum follow-up, 6.5 years) was 72.1, 36.9, and 19.9 months in the combination, nivolumab, and ipilimumab groups, respectively. Median MSS was not reached, 58.7, and 21.9 months, respectively; 6.5-year OS rates were 57%, 43%, and 25% in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors and 46%, 42%, and 22% in those with BRAF–wild-type tumors, respectively. In patients who discontinued treatment, the median treatment-free interval was 27.6, 2.3, and 1.9 months, respectively. Since the 5-year analysis, no new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSION These 6.5-year CheckMate 067 results, which include the longest median OS in a phase III melanoma trial reported to date and the first report of MSS, showed durable, improved clinical outcomes with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma and, in descriptive analyses, with the combination over nivolumab monotherapy. Checkmate-067 shows median OS for ipi+nivo in metastatic melanoma = 6 years. Quite a change from the chemo era, when 7 months was norm."
d3db55acf61e18e98f5bc4d3e9272ee6f2407c0b,"9506 Background: In the phase 3 CheckMate 067 trial, a durable and sustained clinical benefit was achieved with nivolumab (NIVO) + ipilimumab (IPI) and NIVO alone vs IPI at 5-y of follow-up (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS] rates: 52%, 44%, 26% and 36%, 29%, 8%, respectively). Here we report 6.5-y efficacy and safety outcomes. Methods: Eligible pts with previously untreated unresectable stage III or IV melanoma were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio and stratified by PD-L1 status, BRAF mutation status, and metastasis stage. Pts received NIVO 1 mg/kg + IPI 3 mg/kg for 4 doses Q3W followed by NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W (n = 314), NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W + placebo (n = 316), or IPI 3 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses + placebo (n = 315) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS with NIVO + IPI or NIVO vs IPI. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), descriptive efficacy assessments of NIVO + IPI vs NIVO alone, and safety. Results: With a minimum follow-up of 6.5 y, median OS was 72.1 mo with NIVO + IPI, 36.9 mo with NIVO, and 19.9 mo with IPI (table). Median time from randomization to subsequent systemic therapy was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 59.6–NR) with NIVO + IPI, 25.2 mo (95% CI, 16.0–43.2) with NIVO, and 8.0 mo (95% CI, 6.5–8.7) with IPI; 36%, 49%, and 66% of pts, respectively, received any subsequent systemic therapy. Median treatment-free interval (which excluded pts who discontinued follow-up prior to initiation of subsequent systemic therapy) was 27.6 mo (range, 0–83.0), 2.3 mo (range, 0.2–81.6), and 1.9 mo (range, 0.1–81.9) with NIVO + IPI, NIVO, and IPI, respectively. Of the pts alive and in follow-up, 112/138 (81%; NIVO + IPI), 84/114 (74%; NIVO), and 27/63 (43%; IPI) were off treatment and never received subsequent systemic therapy; 7, 8, and 0 pts, respectively, were still on treatment. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 59% of NIVO + IPI-treated pts, 24% of NIVO-treated pts, and 28% of IPI-treated pts. Since the 5-y analysis, no new safety signals were observed and no additional treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusions: This 6.5-y analysis represents the longest follow-up from a phase 3 melanoma trial in the modern checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy and targeted therapy era. The results show durable improved outcomes with NIVO + IPI and NIVO vs IPI in pts with advanced melanoma. We observed improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR with NIVO + IPI over NIVO alone.

d614d82dfe6c394a5219951f2acce20102076d86,"Background Viral-based immunotherapy can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and fill the unmet needs of many patients with cancer. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are defined as engineered or naturally occurring viruses that selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells. OVs also induce antitumor immunity. The purpose of this study was to compare the antitumor effects of live oncolytic vaccinia viruses versus the inactivated versions and elucidate their underlying immunological mechanisms. Methods We engineered a replication-competent, oncolytic vaccinia virus (OV-GM) by inserting a murine GM-CSF gene into the thymidine kinase locus of a mutant vaccinia E3L∆83N, which lacks the Z-DNA-binding domain of vaccinia virulence factor E3. We compared the antitumor effects of intratumoral (IT) delivery of live OV-GM versus heat-inactivated OV-GM (heat-iOV-GM) in a murine B16-F10 melanoma bilateral implantation model. We also generated vvDD, a well-studied oncolytic vaccinia virus, and compared the antitumor effects of live vvDD vs heat-inactivated vvDD (heat-ivvDD) in a murine A20 B-cell lymphoma bilateral tumor implantation model. Results Heat-iOV-GM infection of dendritic cells (DCs) and tumor cells in vitro induced type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, whereas live OV-GM did not. IT live OV-GM was less effective in generating systemic antitumor immunity compared with heat-iOV-GM. Similar to heat-iOV-GM, the antitumor effects of live OV-GM also require Batf3-dependent CD103+ dendritic cells. When combined with systemic delivery of ICB, IT heat-iOV-GM was more effective in eradicating tumors, compared with live OV-GM. IT heat-ivvDD was also more effective in treating murine A20 B-cell lymphoma, compared with live vvDD. Conclusions Tumor lysis induced by the replication of oncolytic vaccinia virus has a limited effect on the generation of systemic antitumor immunity. The activation of Batf3-dependent CD103+ DCs is critical for antitumor effects induced by both live OV-GM and heat-iOV-GM, with the latter being more potent than live OV-GM in inducing innate and adaptive immunity in both locally injected and distant, non-injected tumors. We propose that evaluations of both innate and adaptive immunity, induced by IT oncolytic viral immunotherapy at injected and non-injected tumors, should be included as potential biomarkers for host responses to viral therapy."

de2eff25fd0e73691c371932bc40c13ad872ce37,"This exploratory analysis investigating biomarkers of response to nivolumab and ipilimumab in melanoma patients demonstrates that combined assessment of tumor mutational burden, an inflammatory gene signature, and BRAF mutation status has the potential to predict response to immunotherapy. Outcomes for patients with melanoma have improved over the past decade as a result of the development and FDA approval of immunotherapies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, these therapies do not benefit all patients, and an area of intensive research investigation is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to benefit from them. Here, we report exploratory analyses of the associations of tumor mutational burden (TMB), a 4-gene inflammatory gene expression signature, and BRAF mutation status with tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma treated as part of the CheckMate 066 and 067 phase III clinical trials evaluating immuno-oncology therapies. In patients enrolled in CheckMate 067 receiving the anti–PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (NIVO) alone or in combination with the anti–CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab (IPI) or IPI alone, longer survival appeared to associate with high (>median) versus low (≤median) TMB and with high versus low inflammatory signature scores. For NIVO-treated patients, the results regarding TMB association were confirmed in CheckMate 066. In addition, improved survival was observed with high TMB and absence of BRAF mutation. Weak correlations were observed between PD-L1, TMB, and the inflammatory signature. Combined assessment of TMB, inflammatory gene expression signature, and BRAF mutation status may be predictive for response to immune checkpoint blockade in advanced melanoma."

e36ac93185edd739e15ea8e15ab63936f7575098,"PURPOSE Nivolumab + ipilimumab (nivo + ipi) is highly efficacious but has high toxicity. Standard treatment in advanced melanoma is four doses of nivo + ipi followed by nivo alone. Whether four doses of nivo + ipi are needed is unclear. METHODS The Adaptively Dosed ImmunoTherapy Trial (ADAPT-IT) study (NCT03122522) is a multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical trial. Patients received two doses of nivo (1 mg/kg) + ipi (3 mg/kg) followed by a computed tomography scan at week 6. Patients without new lesions or index lesion tumor growth of > 4% had protocol-defined early favorable antitumor effect (FATE) and ceased nivo + ipi, transitioning to nivo monotherapy. Patients without FATE at week 6 received the standard third and fourth doses of nivo + ipi followed by nivo monotherapy. The primary end point was response rate by RECIST 1.1 at week 12. Secondary end points included additional efficacy assessments and safety. RESULTS Sixty patients were enrolled; 41 patients (68%) had FATE at week 6 and met criteria for stopping nivo + ipi. Best overall response rates by RECIST at week 12 or any time afterward were 48% (95% CI, 35 to 62) and 58% (95% CI, 45 to 71), respectively. With a median follow-up of 25 months, the estimated 18-month progression-free survival and overall survival are 52% and 80%, respectively. Fifty seven percent of patients had grade 3-5 treatment-related toxicity. CONCLUSION The efficacy and toxicity of standard four dose nivo + ipi induction therapy in melanoma is likely driven by the first two doses.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated, non-replicative vaccinia virus that has a long history of human use. Here we report that IT recombinant MVA (rMVA), lacking E5R encoding an inhibitor of the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), expressing a dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), and a T cell co-stimulator, OX40L, generates strong antitumor immunity, which is dependent on CD8+ T cells, the cGAS/STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and STAT1/STAT2-mediated type I IFN signaling. Remarkably, IT rMVA depletes OX40hi regulatory T cells via OX40L/OX40 interaction and IFNAR signaling. Taken together, our study provides a proof-of-concept for improving MVA-based cancer immunotherapy, through modulation of both innate and adaptive immunity.

Here, we report a scTCR/RNA-seq dataset of 162,062 single T cells from 31 tissue regions, including tumor, adjacent normal tissues, and lymph nodes (LN), from three patients who underwent resections for progressing lung cancers after immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We found marked regional heterogeneity in tumor persistence that was associated with heterogeneity in CD4 and CD8 T cell phenotypes; regions with persistent cancer cells were enriched for follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH), regulatory T cells (Treg), and exhausted CD8 T cells. Clonal analysis demonstrated that highly-expanded T cell clones were predominantly of the CD8 subtype, were ubiquitously present across all sampled regions, found in the peripheral circulation, and expressed gene signatures of ‘large’ and ‘dual-expanded’ clones that have been predictive of response to ICB. Longitudinal tracking of CD8 T cell clones in the peripheral blood revealed that the persistence of ubiquitous CD8 T cell clones, as well as phenotypically distinct clones with tumor-reactive features, correlated with systemic tumor control. Finally, tracking CD8 T cell clones across tissues revealed the presence of TCF-1+ precursor exhausted CD8 T cells in tumor draining LNs that were clonally linked to expanded exhausted CD8 T cells in tumors. Altogether, this comprehensive scTCR/RNA-seq dataset with regional, longitudinal, and clonal resolution provides fundamental insights into the tissue distribution, persistence, and differentiation trajectories of ICB-responsive T cells that underlie clinical responses to ICB."

Rigorous biomarker analyses from prior ipilimumab randomized studies without nivolumab are likely to inform which biomarker analyses should be prioritized when examining patients treated with the combination. For the first time, the current analyses investigate absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in randomized, controlled trials of ipilimumab without nivolumab to assess whether ALC is prognostic or predictive of ipilimumab treatment benefit. Data included patients (n = 1136) treated in the two randomized, controlled phase III studies MDX010-20 and CA184-024. ALC was measured at pretreatment baseline and every 3 weeks for up to 12 weeks, before each dose of ipilimumab. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate and test associations between ALC measures and overall survival (OS). In both randomized studies, baseline ALC and ALC halfway through induction (at week 6) were associated with OS not only in ipilimumab-treated patients but also in patients treated with non-ipilimumab control treatments. ALC increased in patients receiving ipilimumab, but this degree of change was not predictive of ipilimumab treatment benefit. Using data from randomized, controlled studies, we were able to conclude for the first time that baseline ALC, ALC halfway through induction (week 6) and the degree of ALC change from baseline to week 6 are prognostic biomarkers in melanoma patients, and do not appear to be predictive of ipilimumab treatment benefit. This more comprehensive understanding of ALC as a biomarker from ipilimumab trials will inform subsequent biomarker investigations in ongoing ipilimumab combination studies such as ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab."

We thus hypothesized that the characteristic tumor metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis could contribute to ICB resistance. High glucose consumption and lactate production by tumor cells can indeed restrict nutrient availability for tumor-infiltrating T cells, which also rely on glycolysis to proliferate and function. Therefore, we investigated whether targeting tumor glucose metabolism potentiates ICB anti-tumor activity. Methods We modeled tumor-selective glycolysis inhibition by knocking down the critical glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA-KD) in the murine metastatic breast carcinoma 4T1 and melanoma B16, which are known immune-refractory tumor models. Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 were tested in immunocompetent mice orthotopically implanted with control vs. LDHA-KD tumor cells. Changes in glucose metabolism were assessed by Seahorse and fluorescent-glucose flow-cytometry staining. Changes in immune cells were measured by multiparameter flow cytometry. Glucose-dependent effects of anti-CTLA-4 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) were tested in standard suppression assays with increasing glucose concentration (0.5–10 mM). Pearson correlations between glycolysis and intra-tumor immune-cell infiltration by CIBERSORT immune-deconvolution method were analyzed in bulk RNA-sequencing data sets from human and murine tumors treated with ICB. Results Comparison of ICB activity in LDHA-KD vs. control tumor-bearing mice revealed improved anti-tumor effects and overall survival in the setting of glycolysis-defective tumors specifically upon CTLA-4 blockade. Anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses correlated with Treg phenotypic and functional destabilization in anti-CTLA-4-treated LDHA-KD tumors. CTLA-4 blockade led to CTLA-4 and CD25 downregulation associated with increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in Tregs from glycolysis-defective vs. control tumors. We next mimicked high- vs. low-glycolysis tumor microenvironment (TME) in vitro using control vs. LDHA-KD tumor co-cultures with Tregs, control vs. LDHA-KD tumor-conditioned media or directly modulating glucose concentrations. In these assays, we observed that CTLA-4 blockade promotes IFN-gamma±TNF-alpha production and glucose uptake by Tregs and more efficiently counteracts Treg suppression and enhances CD28 co-stimulation at higher glucose concentrations. Lastly, by interrogating transcriptomic data from human melanoma and murine 4T1 tumors, we found that CTLA-4 blockade promotes immune-cell infiltration and metabolic fitness especially in glycolysis-defective tumors. Conclusions Our findings indicate that increasing glucose availability in the TME may improve anti-CTLA-4 therapeutic activity and reveal a new mechanism through which CTLA-4 blockade interferes with Treg immunosuppression in a glucose-dependent manner. These results suggest that CTLA-4 blockade can be more effective in tumors with low glycolysis and/or can be best exploited in combination with inhibitors of tumor glycolysis."

 Despite adequate oxygen levels, cancer cells undergo anaerobic glycolysis converting glucose to lactate (the Warburg effect). It is now thought that the advantage of this for the cancer cell is that it provides the carbon and nitrogen precursors critical for macromolecule synthesis (amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids) while still providing an adequate supply of ATP needed for growth. Understanding this metabolic landscape may provide strategies to overcome mechanisms of resistance to therapy in melanoma. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to inactivate BRAF by phosphorylating Ser 729, and in preclinical models, this can be used to enhance inhibitors of BRAFV600E. In the high ATP environment of a melanoma cell, AMPK is typically low but inducers of AMPK, such as biguanides, increase AMPK. The biguanide metformin does not enter melanoma cells efficiently due to the lack of organic cation transporter (OCT) expression on melanoma cells. However, phenformin does not require OCT for uptake. We are conducting a phase I trial in BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma patients using dabrafenib/trametinib and escalating doses of phenformin. One of the pharmacodynamic effects of phenformin is weight loss, which we are measuring. Interestingly, obesity has been associated with improved outcome in male melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 antibodies. In contrast, our data in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy do not show an association between outcome and obesity. Another consequence of anaerobic glycolysis is generation and excretion of large amounts of lactate. There is evidence that lactate can inhibit T-cell function, and we will discuss strategies to block lactate transport to enhance immunotherapy.

 Over the past decade, blockade of the immune checkpoints CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 has been demonstrated to significantly extend survival of cancer patients across multiple tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, formally proving that immunotherapy is a viable option for the treatment of cancer. These successes have paved the way for the development of additional immune-modulatory antibodies, blocking alternative inhibitory receptors, or engaging costimulatory receptors such as the TNF receptor family member GITR. However, the clinical experience accumulated thus far with checkpoint blockade has clearly shown that only a limited fraction of patients achieve durable clinical benefit with these treatments. This highlights the need to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying response and resistance to immunotherapy and design more personalized and rational combinations based on these therapies. Immune-regulatory mechanisms are one of the major barriers limiting efficacy of immunotherapy. CTLA-4 blockade and GITR costimulation are two immunotherapeutic strategies known to interfere with conventional immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). We thus investigated the effects of CTLA-4 blockade and GITR costimulation on suppressive T cells in in vivo mouse melanoma models resistant to these therapies with the aim to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying refractoriness and provide the rationale to develop more effective therapeutic combinations. To understand the clinical relevance of these findings, we explored the same effects in cancer patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade or GITR costimulation. We found that CTLA-4 blockade, while counteracting conventional Tregs, promotes the expansion of a subset of CD4+Foxp3-T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 (4PD1hi), which constitute a new immunosuppressive T-cell population with T-follicular-helper-like features. Importantly, we observed that anti-CTLA-4 increases the frequency of circulating 4PD1hi in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, PD-1 blockade decreases 4PD1hi in function of its clinical activity, underscoring the relevance of this cell subset as a pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarker of checkpoint blockade. These findings indicate that optimizing checkpoint blockade doses and combination regimens so as to keep 4PD1hi in the right balance may favor a positive outcome. In mouse melanoma models of response (early tumors) and refractoriness (advanced tumors) to GITR agonism, we found that anti-GITR efficiently reduces Tregs and increases effector:Treg ratios in both curative and refractory treatment conditions. However, T-cell activation and cytotoxic functions are favored selectively in the presence of low tumor burden. Counteracting exhaustion with PD-1 blockade in combination with GITR agonism restored responsiveness of advanced tumors and CD8+ T-cell functionality. Aligned with the effects of anti-GITR in mice, we found that the agonist anti-human GITR antibody TRX518 decreases Tregs in peripheral blood and tumor to similar extents in patients treated in the first-in-human single-dose monotherapy trial (NCT01239134). However, coincident downregulation of Tregs in the peripheral blood and at the tumor site upon TRX518 was not sufficient to achieve substantial clinical responses in this population of advanced solid cancer patients. This suggests that Treg elimination from advanced tumors may not be sufficient to activate cytotoxic T-cell responses unless the T-cell exhaustion process is concurrently blocked. Based on these preclinical and clinical observations, we have started to explore anti-GITR in combination with PD-1 pathway blockade in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02628574). Taken as a whole, these findings illustrate the value of conventional and nonconventional immune-suppressive T cells as biomarkers of biologic and therapeutic activity of immunotherapy in melanoma and other tumor types. In addition, these results indicate that inhibition of immune-regulatory mechanisms, such as immunosuppressive T cells, may need to be associated with strategies able to positively activate T-cell responses to achieve significant clinical benefit.

Methods Single cell-RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data derived from the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of melanoma patients9 were used for transcriptomic analysis and flow cytometry results were used to quantify protein levels in TILs. Murine B16-F10 (B16) melanoma model was used for both in vitro and in vivo studies. TCR-transgenic Pmel-1 and OT-1 transgenic mice, as well as CD47-/- (knockout, KO) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory to generate CD47+/+ (wild-type, WT), CD47± (heterozygote, HET) mice with Pmel-1 or OT-1 background. For T cell co-transfer studies, Rag-deficient mice or C57BL/6j mice with sub-lethal irradiation (600cGy) were used as recipients. Naive TCR-transgenic CD47-WT and CD47-HET CD8+ T cells were labelled, mixed in a 1:1 ratio for co-transfer experiments. Results Flow cytometry analysis of human melanoma TILs found a strong upregulation of CD47 expression in tumor-associated, exhausted CD8+ T cells. We confirmed that CD47 transcription is significantly elevated among CD8+ T cells with a phenotype consistent with exhaustion using scRNA-seq results of TILs derived from melanoma patients.9 Our study in murine B16 melanoma model confirms our finding in melanoma patients. To specifically address the role of CD47 in anti-tumor CD8 effector function, we conducted T cell co-transfer studies and found that CD8+ T cells with lower copy number of CD47 (CD47-HET) significantly outnumber the co-transferred CD47-WT CD8+ T cells within the tumor, exhibiting an enhanced effector function and less exhausted phenotype. Our study demonstrates a potentially novel role for CD47 in mediating CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Conclusions CD47 expression in CD8+ T cells programs T cells toward exhaustion.

Clinical trials have explored RT with single-agent immune checkpoint blockade, but no trials have reported RT with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Patients and Methods: We conducted a phase 1 study of patients with stage IV melanoma receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab with two different dose-fractionation schemes of RT. Patients had at least one melanoma metastasis that would benefit from palliative RT and one metastasis that would not be irradiated. Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and extracranial RT with a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions was administered in Cohort A, and then 27 Gy in 3 fractions was administered in Cohort B. The primary outcome was safety. Results: Twenty patients were treated (10 in each cohort). The rates of treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events in Cohort A and B were 40% and 30%, respectively. There were no grade ≥3 adverse events attributed to RT. Patients responded to treatment outside of the irradiated volume (Cohort A 5/10; Cohort B 1/9). No evaluable patients had progression of irradiated metastases. Immunologic changes were seen in the peripheral blood with increases in T-cell receptor diversity in some responding patients. Conclusions: RT with nivolumab and ipilimumab was safe compared with historical data of nivolumab and ipilimumab alone. Immunologic effects were observed in the peripheral blood. Randomized studies are ongoing to assess whether RT increases the efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab."

Targeted therapy to inhibit MEK signaling has shown promising tumor growth control in preclinical models, but is followed by quick rebound in tumor growth. Recently, immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated clinical activity by dis-inhibiting T cells suppressed in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we sought to identify the most effective therapy for the treatment of KRAS mutant NSCLC patients by targeting cancer cells and activating immune infiltrating cell populations concurrently. To achieve this, we focused on studying the impact of pulsatile MEK inhibition on the immune microenvironment utilizing Kras mutant lung cancer cell lines and Kras mutant transgenic lung cancer mouse models. We found that pulsatile MEK inhibition maintained T cell activation better than continuous treatment ex vivo and in vivo. Treatment with two different MEK inhibitors (selumetinib and trametinib) each resulted in higher CTLA-4 and PD-1 expression in T cells using pulsatile treatment, compared to continuous treatment ex vivo. In addition, the pulsatile schedule showed superior anti-tumor effects and delayed drug resistance compared to continuous administration in vivo. Further, a combination of pulsatile MEK inhibitor treatment and CTLA-4 blockade resulted in the most prolonged survival of Kras tumor-bearing mice. Similar experiments in immune-deficient mice confirmed that this prolonged survival is conferred by adaptive immunity. Our findings set the foundation for a combinatorial therapeutic strategy using pulsatile targeted therapy together with immune checkpoint blockade in patients to optimally enhance tumor apoptosis and promote long-term immune response simultaneously. We are now continuing our studies using a KRAS G12C inhibitor to define its immune modulating properties and will then rationally combine with immune based therapy.

For patients with metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy with checkpoint blocking antibodies is a standard of care. In patients with concomitant CLL and metastatic melanoma, it is not known whether CLL might influence the antimelanoma efficacy or immune-related toxicities of immune checkpoint blockade. Fifteen patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma and a concomitant diagnosis of CLL who received pembrolizumab or ipilimumab with or without nivolumab for the treatment of their melanoma at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2017, were retrospectively identified. Clinical characteristics including absolute lymphocyte counts during therapy were recorded along with a response to treatment (objective radiographic response, progression-free survival, and adverse events) for each patient. Of 9 response-evaluable patients treated with ipilimumab, 3 (33%) had a partial response, 1 (11%) had stable disease, and 5 (56%) developed progressive disease. Objective tumor responses were also observed with single-agent therapy pembrolizumab and with combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in 6 of 15 patients (40%), including diarrhea, transaminitis, rash, and hemolytic anemia. Although our retrospective assessment was limited, there was no evidence that CLL responded to the checkpoint blockade. This case series demonstrates that ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and combined ipilimumab and nivolumab therapies show clinical activity in patients with melanoma and concomitant CLL, at rates consistent with those previously reported. This population may warrant closer surveillance for hematologic immune-related toxicities such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia."
83389d3c2c572154290ea67e6baa64f5f4eae29f,"Targeted immune therapies such as adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) are often ineffective because tumors evolve over time under selective pressure to display antigen loss variant.  A classic example is de-differentiation and loss of expression of antigenic proteins. Therapies that activate multiple branches of the immune system may eliminate escape variants. Here we show that melanoma-specific CD4+ ACT therapy in combination with OX40 co-stimulation or CTLA-4 blockade can eradicate melanomas that contain clonal escape variants. As expected, early on-target recognition of melanoma antigens by adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was required. Surprisingly, complete tumor eradication was partially dependent on neutrophils. Supporting these findings, extensive neutrophil extracellular traps were found in mouse tumors and in biopsies of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade.

However, detailed biomarkers of response beyond tumor mutational burden (TMB) are still poorly understood. As part of the effort to elucidate these additional signatures, we describe our progress on the Stand Up to Cancer Lung (SU2C-Lung) cohort. Initial characterization of exomes recapitulates mutational and copy number profiles seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. To better define expression subtypes using RNA sequencing, we performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) across an aggregated set of publicly available NSCLC expression data (including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine histologies), and demonstrate good concordance in the SU2C-Lung cohort between this expression-based classifier and clinically annotated histology. To gain further insight into how immune cell infiltrates vary across our cohort, we additionally tested two common deconvolution algorithms, EPIC and CIBERSORT. While these two methods agree for some prominent cell types, such as B cells and CD4 T cells, discrepancies in minor infiltrating components such as NK cells may suggest a limit to the inference of rare subpopulations from bulk sequencing data.Finally, we describe a novel approach for determining single-gene predictors of response. Using the method, which is based on comparison of top single transcriptional features identified from random bootstraps of the full cohort as compared to a set of background shuffles, we are able to show that we remain powered for discovery of RNA response biomarkers despite the typically burdensome toll of multiple hypothesis correction at genome wide scale.

 Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a viable strategy to treat cancer. T cells that recognize tumor antigens can be reinvigorated ex-vivo or autologous T cells can be genetically modified to express anti-tumor T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). However, once re-infused into patients, these tumor specific T cells are subjected to immunosuppressive signals within the tumor. A critical immune checkpoint within tumors is phosphatidylserine (PS), a phospholipid that is exposed on apoptotic cells and tumor cells. Innate cells exposed to PS secrete suppressive cytokines that can significantly impair the function of tumor specific T cells. Antibodies that target PS can reactivate anti-tumor immunity by reducing the number of MDSCs in tumors and promoting the maturation of functional APCs. Our lab has shown that the mouse chimeric version of PS Targeting monoclonal antibody Bavituximab (1N11), in combination with transgenic CD4+ T cells that recognize melanoma antigen Trp1, can regress advanced melanoma tumors in mice. Here, we demonstrate a 2nd generation CAR T cell, that binds Trp1 on the surface of B16 melanoma, in combination with 1N11 can improve anti-tumor activity and survival in B16 tumor bearing mice. Flow cytometry analysis of immune responses in the tumor of mice treated with tumor specific T cells and 1N11 shows a decrease in M2 macrophages and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. These findings highlight that diminishing suppressive mechanisms locally with PS targeting can enhance the efficacy of transgenic TCR and CAR T cells to improve the outcome in patients with advanced-stage melanoma. Our studies may inform the design of clinical trials combining PS Targeting antibodies with CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors."

9a1763c975c41518ff0a4562ce8d5bc10d97e282,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has been shown to convey significant clinical activity across a spectrum of malignancies, yet there is now recognition that multiple mechanisms of resistance can impair response. The catabolism of tryptophan into metabolites known as kynurenines (Kyn) by enzymes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) plays a major suppressive role. Recently it was shown that Kyn acts as an endogenous agonist of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In order to gain a better understanding of this pathway, we sought to characterize the mechanisms of immunosuppression associated with AhR and evaluate its potential as therapeutic target. Gene-expression analysis of IDO-overexpressing melanomas (B16-IDO vs. B16-WT) demonstrated reduced expression levels of Type 1 inflammatory genes, including IFNy, TNF, GzmB, and CD40. In addition, B16-IDO presents higher infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages TAMs, which upregulate the AHR as well as classic AhR-regulated genes (Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1) and are differentially skewed towards an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Tumor-antigen specific CD8+T cells show reduced expression of activation markers (GzmB and CD44) and proliferation rate when primed by Kyn-treated antigen-presenting cells. In addition, TAMs from B16-IDO tumors suppressed activation of CD8+T cells in vitro and their depletion delayed tumor growth. When B16-IDO cells are implanted in mice depleted of Foxp3 expressing cells, TAMs do not accumulate. Treatment of B16-IDO tumors with an AhR-specific antagonist (CH-223191) upregulates MHC II in APCs, activation markers in CD8s, and reduced frequency of T-regs in B16-IDO tumors. AhR inhibition slows tumor growth and prolongs survival of tumors with active IDO/TDO/Kyn pathway (B16-IDO and B16-TDO), and this is enhanced when PD-1 blockade is used in combination. In summary, our findings demonstrate that targeting the Kyn pathway through AhR inhibition could overcome key suppressive mechanisms and sensitize tumors to ICB.

However, studies have shown that CALRMUT-specific T cells are rare in CALRMUT MPN patients, but the underlying reasons for this phenomenon are unknown. Methods In this study, we examine class-I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) allele frequency in CALRMUT MPN patients from two independent cohorts and observed that MHC-I alleles that present CALRMUT neoepitopes with high affinity are under-represented in CALRMUT MPN patients. We speculate that this is due to an increased chance of immune-mediated tumor rejection by individuals expressing one of these MHC-I alleles such that the disease never clinically manifests. As a consequence of this MHC-I allele restriction, we reasoned that CALRMUT MPN patients would not efficiently respond to cancer vaccines composed of the CALRMUT fragment, but could do so when immunized with a properly modified CALRMUT heteroclitic peptide vaccine approach. Results We found that heteroclitic CALRMUT peptides specifically designed for CALRMUT MPN patient MHC-I alleles efficiently elicited a cross-reactive CD8+ T cell response in human PBMC samples otherwise unable to respond to the matched weakly immunogenic CALRMUT native peptides. We also modeled this effect in mice and observed that C57BL/6J mice, which are unable to mount an immune response to the human CALRMUT fragment, can mount a cross-reactive CD8+ T cell response against a CALRMUT-derived peptide upon heteroclitic peptide immunization and this was further amplified by combining the heteroclitic peptide vaccine with blockade of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-1. Conclusions Together, our data underscore the therapeutic potential of heteroclitic peptide-based cancer vaccines in CALRMUT MPN patients.

a8075adc012052c03b331d5f0ed89d69d5fb1361,"Background: Patients with lung cancers may have distinct vulnerability to severe COVID-19. Understanding the patient-specific and cancer-specific features that impact severity of COVID-19 may inform optimal cancer care during this pandemic. A key question is whether PD-1 blockade therapy impacts COVID-19 severity. Methods: We identified consecutive patients with lung cancer and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test seen at a single cancer center in New York City. We performed detailed manual review of the disease course, medical and oncologic history. COVID-19 severity outcomes were predefined, including need for hospitalization, ICU/intubation/transition to DNI-status, or death. We examined clinical features associated with severity using single and multivariable analyses. Regarding the impact of PD-1 blockade, we prespecified several bio-plausible comparisons of PD-1 exposure. HLA alleles were inferred from NGS and compared to controls with lung cancer and no known COVID-19. Results: We identified 102 patients with lung cancers and a SARS-CoV-2 positive swab between March 12, 2020 and May 6, 2020. Patients were followed until May 11, 2020. COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancers (62% hospitalized, 25% died), but accounted for only 11% of deaths among patients with lung cancer during the pandemic. Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient specific, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies, did not impact severity. Likelihood of severe COVID-19 was generally similar across HLA class I supertypes. We found no significant differences in the impact of PD-1 blockade on COVID-19 severity. Modest numerical increases in severity of COVID-19 associated with prior PD-1 blockade were diminished (Odds ratio 0.86-1.01) after adjusting for expected imbalances in prior smoking history. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% of patients initially requiring intubation. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of severity in patients with lung cancers. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, were the greatest determinants of severity. In particular, PD-1 blockade did not appear to impact severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers. Citation Format: Jia Luo, Hira Rizvi, Isabel R. Preeshagul, Jacklynn V.

ace4ced7de26a5a77c459b43eb50e9bc67f6c6d2,"Cytosolic DNA is characteristic of chromosomally unstable metastatic cancer cells, resulting in constitutive activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. How tumors co-opt inflammatory signaling while evading immune surveillance remains unknown. Here we show that the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 promotes metastasis by selectively degrading extracellular cGAMP, an immune stimulatory metabolite whose breakdown products include the immune suppressor, adenosine. ENPP1 loss suppresses metastasis, restores tumor immune infiltration, and potentiates response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. Conversely, overexpression of wildtype ENPP1, but not an enzymatically weakened mutant, promotes migration and metastasis, in part, through the generation of extracellular adenosine, and renders otherwise sensitive tumors completely resistant to immunotherapy. In human cancers, ENPP1 expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, increased metastasis, and resistance to anti-PD1/PD-L1 treatment. Thus, cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 enables chromosomally unstable tumors to transmute cGAS activation into an immune suppressive pathway."

To analyze long-term outcomes after treatment discontinuation of anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy in a cohort of patients with melanoma with the longest follow-up yet available to our knowledge, including a majority of patients treated outside of a clinical trial. We also assessed efficacy of retreatment with anti-PD-1 therapy with or without ipilimumab in relapsing patients.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed all patients with nonuveal, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering from 2009-2018 who had discontinued treatment and had at least 3 months of follow-up after discontinuation (n = 396). Overall survival for patients with complete response (CR) was calculated from time of CR. Time to treatment failure for patients with CR was time from CR to the next melanoma treatment or death.


RESULTS
CRs were seen in 102 of 396 patients (25.8%). The median number of months of treatment after CR was zero (range, stopped before CR to 26 months after CR). With a median follow-up of 21.1 months from time of CR in patients who did not relapse, the probability of being alive and not needing additional melanoma therapy at 3 years was 72.1%. There was no significant association between treatment duration and relapse risk. In multivariable analysis, CR was associated with M1b disease and cutaneous versus mucosal or acral primaries. Among the 78 patients (of 396) retreated after disease progression, response was seen in 5 of 34 retreated patients with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy and 11 of 44 patients escalated to anti-PD-1 plus ipilimumab.


CONCLUSION
In our cohort, most patients discontinued treatment at the time of CR. Most CRs were durable but the probability of treatment failure was 27% at 3 years. Responses to retreatment were infrequent. The optimal duration of treatment after CR is not yet established."
b487e1177ded76ec20dd4e38c5e3f0ee223e0a50,"Clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) following checkpoint blockade (CB) can precede radiographic response,1 2 though current state of the art ctDNA detection via targeted panels faces limited sensitivity in low burden disease (figure 1). We previously showed that whole genome sequencing (WGS) of plasma can overcome low input of ctDNA to dynamically track low volume malignancy using matched tumor tissue.3 We therefore sought to evaluate ctDNA for tracking early response to checkpoint blockade (CB) in melanoma, and developed a novel classifier that allows us to track disease without matched tumor tissue for expanded applicability in immunotherapy.To identify ctDNA sparsely diluted in noncancerous plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA), we developed Phoenix, a deep-learning classifier that uses genomic and epigenomic features to distinguish single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in melanoma from sequencing noise. We evaluated Phoenix on a retrospective cohort of serially sampled plasma from patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma on CB (nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab). Plasma was collected at 0, 3, 6 and 12 weeks after first dose of immunotherapy. ctDNA dynamics were compared to radiographic imaging results at 12 weeks.We trained Phoenix on tumor-confirmed SNVs in plasma from a single patient with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) melanoma and cfDNA from age-matched patients without known cancer. Overall ctDNA signal-to-noise enrichment ranged from 100 - 260x in validation patients (n=2) with bulky disease. Phoenix learned key features of melanoma ctDNA including the UV mutational signature and short fragment size (figure 2), and sensitively tracked persistent low burden disease seen on imaging (figure 3). To validate these findings, we expanded our cohort (n= 15) of serially tracked tumors. In our preliminary analysis of 12 patients, Phoenix detected pretreatment ctDNA in 92% of patients at a specificity of 97% (figure 4), compared with only 17% with the benchmark in the field (iChorCNA, a plasma-based WGS liquid biopsy tool; table 1). Phoenix detected a decrease in ctDNA 3 weeks after initiation of CB in 80% of patients (figure 5) with an objective response on imaging. No change in ctDNA was seen in patients who did not respond to treatment.Phoenix successfully identified pretreatment melanoma ctDNA without matched tumor tissue and identified response to CB as early as 3 weeks after treatment. Our ongoing studies aim to optimize this technology for early identification of CB response in clinical practice.Abstract 33 Figure 1WGS of plasma increases sensitivity in low-burden diseaseLikelihood of ctDNA SNV detection is a function of tumor fraction, depth, and breadth (number of candidate sites). Because the limited number of genomic equivalents exhausts depth in targeted sequencing, detection sensitivity is limited by the relatively small number of sites in a clinical panel. In contrast, WGS at modest depth (35x) can detect low tumor fraction by integrating signal from thousands of SNVs across the genome.Abstract 33 Figure 2Phoenix learns key covariates for melanoma ctDNAPhoenix was trained on tumor-confirmed SNVs in plasma from patients with high burden melanoma and cfDNA from age-matched patients without known cancer. We aggregated Phoenix positive (ctDNA, blue) and negative (cfDNA, red) predictions on SNVs from a held out validation melanoma plasma sample. Phoenix ctDNA predictions correctly reflect important melanoma SNV attributes including UV-signature (C>T trinucleotide context, a), low DNase accessibility (b), late replication timing (c), and short fragment length (d).Abstract 33 Figure 3Phoenix sensitively tracks response to nivolumabPlasma samples were collected to monitor treatment response to nivolumab. Treatment monitoring by computed tomography (CT) shows response to therapy but residual disease after 3 months of therapy (a). Phoenix quantifies tumor response, matching radiographic changes, in higher temporal resolution than what is feasible with imaging (b). IchorCNA sensitivity captures initial treatment response dynamics but does not detect residual disease after 3 months of treatment (c). Log z score is calculated from a single plasma sample for each timepoint compared to a panel of control samples (n = 37).Abstract 33 Table 1Characteristics of patients at baseline and ctDNA dynamicsBaseline characteristics for preliminary validation cohort (n=12)Abstract 33 Figure 4Phoenix detects pre- and intratreatment melanoma ctDNAWe evaluated Phoenix post-filter sample-level detection rate. Phoenix detects ctDNA in 92% of pretreatment melanoma plasma samples (green, n=12) at a specificity of 97% relative to held-out noncancerous controls (blue, n=38). Phoenix detected ctDNA in 84% of postreatment plasma samples (n=38, yellow), indicating full ctDNA clearance in 7/38 samples.Abstract 33 Figure 5ctDNA response to checkpoint blockade after 3 weeksSerial plasma samples were taken from patients on checkpoint blockade (nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab). ctDNA burden was measured as detection rate among post-filter candidate SNVs and compared to a 97% specificity boundary among a panel of healthy controls. Phoenix detects a response to checkpoint blockade, measured as a decrease in ctDNA detection rate, as early as 3 weeks as shown in 3 patients (MSK-38, MSK-40, MSK 42).Thanks to support from the Conquer Cancer FoundationUse of human data in this study was approved by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s IRB, Assurance Number FWA0000499Zhang Q, Luo J, et al.

Methods We retrospectively annotated sites of metastases in 500 patients with lung cancer and assessed for clinical outcomes. Utilizing a combination of flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and antibody biodistribution assays, we surveyed for Tim-4 expression across various tissues and cell types. We performed flow cytometry on 55 consecutive pleural and peritoneal effusions from patients with lung cancer. We utilized murine models of peritoneal carcinomatosis to determine whether Tim-4 abrogation could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. We characterized CD8+ T cells with high levels of phosphatidylserine (PShigh) with flow cytometry, cytotoxicity assays, and paired single cell RNA and TCR sequencing. Confocal microscopy was utilized to visualize interactions between Tim-4+ macrophages and PShigh CD8+ T cells. Results Metastatic disease involvement of the pleural or peritoneal cavity was associated with reduced response rate and progression-free and overall survival. We demonstrate that Tim-4 is highly expressed on pleural and peritoneal macrophages and other select resident macrophages, but not on monocytes, tumor-associated macrophages, or tumor cells in mice and humans. High levels of Tim-4 on macrophages from fluid biospecimens is associated with reduced levels CD39+ CD8+ T cells, which comprise the tumor-reactive portion of CD8+ T lymphocytes. In order to further elucidate the mechanism of Tim-4+ macrophage-mediated immunosuppression, we established a murine model of peritoneal carcinomatosis with MC38 and CT26 colon carcinoma. Genetic or pharmacologic abrogation of Tim-4 improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and was associated with enhanced CD39+ CD8+ T cell numbers. In parallel, we observed in mice and humans that CD8+ T cell activation results in PS upregulation despite not undergoing cell death. PShigh CD8+ T cells expressed genes associated with cytotoxicity, activation/exhaustion, and proliferation, and mediated greater cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tim-4 mediates sequestration of PShigh CD8+ T cells by macrophages which subsequently impedes CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Conclusions We demonstrate that Tim-4+ resident macrophages impair anti-tumor CD8+ T cell immunity in the serous body cavities and Tim-4 blockade represents on a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (figure 1).

During development in the thymus, transcription factors ThPOK and Runx3 regulate the differentiation and maturation of these two lineages into single positive T cells that enter the periphery with mutually exclusive expression of either the CD4 or CD8 co-receptor.1–2 Despite our expectation that these two cell fates are fixed, mature CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) T cells have been described in the context of numerous immunological responses, including cancer, but their molecular and functional properties and therapeutic relevance remain controversial and largely unknown.3–5 Methods Our lab has identified and characterized a heterogenous DP T cell population in murine and human melanoma tumors comprised of CD4 and CD8 T cells re-expressing the opposite co-receptor and a parallel uptake in the opposite cell type’s phenotype and function. Using CD4 (Trp1) and CD8 (Pmel) transgenic TCR T cells specific to B16 melanoma antigens gp75 and gp100 respectively, we demonstrate the re-expression of the opposite co-receptor following adoptive T cell transfer in B16 melanoma tumor bearing mice. Results Specifically, up to 50% of transferred CD4 Trp1 T cells will re-express CD8 to become a DP T cell in the tumor microenvironment. Further, these CD4 derived DP T cells upregulate CD8 lineage regulator Runx3 and cytolytic genes Gzmb, Gzmk, and Prf1 to become potent cytotoxic T cells. Alternatively, a subset of CD8 Pmel T cells differentiate into DP T cells characterized by the increased expression of CD4, ThPOK, and regulatory marker FoxP3 (figure 1). In addition, we utilized 10x single cell and ATAC sequencing to further characterize these divergent DP T cell populations among open repertoire T cells isolated from murine and human melanoma tumors. Conclusions Our findings highlight the capability of single positive T cells to differentiate in response to antigen and local stimuli into novel T cell subsets with polyfunctional characteristics. The resulting cell subsets will potentially affect the tumor microenvironment in distinct ways. Our studies may inform therapeutic approaches to identify antigen specific T cells as well as innovative signaling pathways to target when genetically engineering T cells to optimize cytotoxic function in the setting of adoptive cell therapy.

Deepening our understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance to these therapies is thus needed to optimize their employment in rational combinations. Cellular energy metabolism reprogramming is a critical hallmark of cancer. High glucose consumption and lactate production by tumor cells restrict nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for effector T cells, which also rely on glycolysis to replicate and function. In addition, immune checkpoints and co-stimulatory molecules are emerging as important regulators of T cell metabolism. Exploiting the capacity of immune checkpoint blockade to perturb T cell metabolism in combination with inhibition of tumor glycolysis may thus be a rational and more effective anti-cancer approach. We investigated the link between tumor glycolysis and immune cell function using RNA sequencing data sets from patients treated with checkpoint blockade and in tumor:T cell co-culture systems. We then studied the effects of checkpoint blockade in syngeneic glycolysis-defective murine tumor models and explored mechanisms underlying anti-tumor activity. We found that expression of glycolysis-related genes is inversely correlated with infiltration of most immune cell types in melanomas from patients before CTLA-4 blockade. However, after treatment, immune-related and glycolysis-related genes were more often co-expressed, suggesting that anti-CTLA-4 may partially restore immune cell fitness in the glycolytic TME. To directly assess the effect of tumor metabolism on T cell function, we co-cultured activated T cells with the highly glycolytic murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 and observed that tumor cells, or similar non-toxic concentrations of exogenous lactate, significantly limited T cell activation and viability. We thus investigated whether inhibition of tumor glycolysis could potentiate the activity of CTLA-4 blockade. We found that neoadjuvant treatment with anti-CTLA-4 significantly prolonged survival in mice bearing glycolysis defective 4T1 tumors, where lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) - the critical enzyme controlling lactate production in aerobic glycolysis - was knocked down (4T1-KD). Intriguingly, tumor protection was associated with intratumoral regulatory T cell (Treg) functional phenotypic destabilization towards IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha producing Tregs. By mimicking the LDH-A-KD and control 4T1 TME in vitro using higher and lower concentrations of glucose, respectively, we showed that CTLA-4 blockade promotes glucose uptake by Tregs and more efficiently counteracts Treg suppression and enhances CD28 co-stimulation at higher glucose concentrations. These findings indicate that rebalancing glucose utilization in favor of immune cells in the TME may facilitate the activity of CTLA-4 blockade and reveal an additional mechanism through which anti-CTLA-4 interferes with Treg function in the presence of glucose.

ed0894c99534f51173d44b094ee955ed2b4fab58,"Given the activity noted with both CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade, clinical trials are now investigating combination checkpoint blockade. The most mature data with a combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab in melanoma showed a response rate of 60% in the context of increased yet manageable toxicity. Such responses are generally durable, even when treatment was stopped early for toxicity. Unlike in studies of PD-1 blockade monotherapy, there was no significant difference in clinical activity based on tumor expression of PD-L1. This approach has gained regulatory approval for metastatic melanoma and is in late-stage clinical trials for other malignancies. Attention is being paid to the reasons underlying the efficacy of checkpoint blockade in certain malignancies. One hypothesis has been that cancers having a high mutational load may be more amenable to immune modulation by virtue of the larger number of potential neoepitopes present, fostering baseline immune recognition that can then be potentiated by checkpoint blockade. We have found that melanoma patients having long-term clinical activity with ipilimumab have a significantly greater median number of nonsynonymous passenger mutations, compared with patients who do not respond or those who have only short-term regression. Strategies to enhance baseline immune reactivity are therefore necessary to investigate as a means to improve the impact of checkpoint blockade on a broad spectrum of cancers. The presence of suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment also is emerging as a mechanism of resistance to the antitumor activity for checkpoint blockade. Strategies to overcome this include inhibition of CSF-1R signaling, IDO activity, and selective suppression of PI3K-γ. Citation Format: Jedd Wolchok.

Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher COVID-19 death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-19 disease4. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. Since March 10th, 2020 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center performed diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients. Overall, 40% out of 423 patients with cancer were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, 20% developed severe respiratory illness, including 9% that required mechanical ventilation, and 9% that died. On multivariate analysis, age [≥] 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) within 90 days were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, while receipt of chemotherapy within 30 days and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 illness is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes in patients with cancer. Association between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes will need interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts."

We identify that the scavenger receptor CD36 limits anti-tumor CD8+ T cell effector functions through lipid peroxidation. In murine tumors, oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) were highly abundant and CD8+ TILs increased uptake and accumulation of lipids and lipid peroxidation. Functionally ‘exhausted’ CD8+ TILs substantially increased CD36 expression and CD36-deficient CD8+ TILs had more robust anti-tumor activity and cytokine production than wild-type cells. We further show that CD36 promotes uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OxLDL) and induces lipid peroxidation in CD8+ TILs, and OxLDL inhibits CD8+ T cell functions in a CD36-dependent manner. Moreover, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) over-expression lowers lipid peroxidation and restores functionalities in CD8+ TILs. These results define a key role for an oxidized lipid-CD36 axis in promoting intratumoral CD8+ T cell dysfunction."

Specific regions of interest (ROIs) are identified via fluorescently labeled visualization markers. Within a given ROI, oligonucleotide tags from labeled, incubated antibodies can be released by area of interest (AOI)-specific exposure to UV light. With DSP, multiple AOIs can be collected within an individual tissue and/or within an individual patient. As with other technologies, technical variation that needs to be accounted before meaningful conclusions can be drawn.1 Herein, we discuss technical considerations for normalizing and examining DSP data with multiple within-sample observations. We have two goals: 1) determine how different technical artifacts affect raw protein or RNA counts 2) provide guidelines for normalization strategies based on the biological questions of interest. To address these, we examine a recent melanoma dataset to quantify protein expression levels in tumor and stroma AOIs and to determine associations of specific proteins with clinical benefit (CB) from immunotherapy. Methods Seventy-nine segmented ROIs containing matched tumor and stroma compartments were examined from eight patients at baseline (range: 4–12 ROIs). Five of these patients showed CB, defined as complete response, partial response, or remaining progression-free for 6 months. Following UV cleavage, liberated oligonucleotide tags were collected via microcapillary into a microtiter plate, and then processed using the nCounter Prep Station and Digital Analyzer as per manufacturer instructions. Results Each AOI included 57 protein counts and six categories of control molecules/metrics (e.g., isotype molecules, AOI-specific cellularity). Before normalization, we examined controls and excluded those showing correlations with CB or segmentation type. We compared different normalization strategies including area and isotype normalization, upper quartile, and RUV.2 For each strategy, we used linear and negative binominal mixed models to correlate protein expression with CB status, segmentation type, or their interaction. Findings consistent throughout many analysis combinations included higher MART1 expression in the CB group, lower PD-L1 and Ki-67 in the CB group, and lower HLA-DR expression in tumor segments of the CB group. Conclusions ROIs can vary in size, cellularity, and staining, and normalization is important to account for technical differences when quantifying expression in spatial profiling studies. Normalization choices can affect outcome, and it is important to check whether proposed control proteins are in fact unassociated with the biological factors of interest. Mixed modeling approaches can be used to simultaneously model variation between ROIs within a sample and determine differences between sample groups.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in clinical benefit for a subset of cancer patients, yet multiple mechanisms of resistance can impair optimal response. The catabolism of tryptophan into metabolites known as kynurenines (Kyn) by the expression of enzymes such as IDO or TDO is a frequent phenomenon that plays a suppressive role in tumor immunity. Recently it was shown that Kyn acts as agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Here we sought to characterize the mechanisms of immune suppression associated with the AHR pathway and to evaluate its potential as therapeutic target. RNAseq analysis of human cancers revealed a correlation between the expressions of AHR-related genes with markers associated with immunotherapy resistance (PD-1, FOXP3, CD206). By using IDO or TDO-overexpressing variants of a melanoma cell model (B16-F10), we found that myeloid cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs), present up-regulation of the AHR. IDO-expressing tumors (B16-IDO) show higher myeloid cell infiltration, which present a tolerogenic phenotype. Tumor-antigen specific CD8T cells present reduced expression of activation markers and proliferation rate when primed by Kyn-treated BMDCs. Treatment of B16-IDO-bearing mice with an AHR-specific antagonist (CH-223191) leads to an increase of MHC II in TAMs, of activation markers in CD8 T cells and reduced frequency of T-regs. AHR inhibition delays progression of tumors with an active IDO/TDO/Kyn pathway (B16-IDO and B16-TDO), and efficacy is further improved when ICB is used in combination. In summary, our findings demonstrate that targeting the Kyn pathway through AHR inhibition could overcome key suppressive mechanisms and sensitize tumors to ICB."

However, many patients are or become refractory to checkpoint blockade. Additional forms of immunotherapy targeting alternative immune pathways are thus needed. Antibodies (Abs) engaging the TNF receptor GITR can enhance T cell functions and counteract regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression and have shown potent anti-tumor activity in animal models. Based on this evidence, we initiated the first in-human phase-I trial with the humanized aglycosylated anti-GITR Ab TRX518 (NCT01239134). Here, we report the immune effects of a single ascending dose of TRX518 monotherapy in 37 advanced cancer patients in this phase-I trial and provide mechanistic preclinical evidence to rationally combine GITR agonism with checkpoint blockade. We found that TRX518 frequently reduces circulating Tregs. In 8 patients for whom pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were available, reductions in intra-tumor and circulating Tregs after TRX518 were positively correlated. Yet, these patients did not experience substantial clinical responses. To explain this outcome, we modeled sensitivity and refractoriness to anti-GITR by treating B16F10-melanoma-bearing mice with the Ab DTA-1 on day 4 (curative regimen) or day 7 (refractory regimen) after tumor implantation respectively. We found that Tregs were significantly reduced and CD8+:Treg and Teff:Treg ratios increased in both responding and refractory tumors. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells from refractory tumors overexpressed T cell exhaustion markers and did not up-regulate memory and functional markers. We thus tested whether counteracting exhaustion could overcome resistance of advanced tumors to anti-GITR. PD-1 blockade in combination with anti-GITR starting on day 7 after tumor implantation controlled tumor growth similar to the curative anti-GITR monotherapy regimen (day 4 treatment) and achieved 50% complete response rate associated with long-lasting anti-tumor immunological memory. This was associated with more activated and less exhausted profiles of intra-tumor CD8+ T cells, which displayed enhanced tumor-lytic capacity compared to CD8+ T cells from non-responding tumors treated with each agent alone. These results indicate that Treg reduction can serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of anti-GITR in patients. However, Treg elimination from advanced tumors may not be sufficient to activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses unless the T cell exhaustion process is concurrently blocked. This provides the rationale to combine immunotherapies targeting Tregs with strategies able to counteract exhaustion, such as anti-PD-1, to regress advanced tumors. Based on these observations, we have started to investigate TRX518 in combination with PD-1 pathway blockade in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02628574).

1770045e9d597db7af2fb7579647251dfdbe95f7,"e23090 Background: Patients with metastatic melanoma (MMel) who achieve durable long-term responses to checkpoint inhibitors (CI) represent a new type of cancer survivor, but their long-term quality of life (QOL) is poorly described. We measured symptom burden and long-term QOL in MMel patients treated with CIs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Methods: Between February and August 2018 we performed a cross-sectional survey of adult patients with MMel treated with CI at MSK beginning at least 12 months prior to this study. Surveys were self-administered online using RedCap. We assessed patient treatment experience and QOL using the PRO-CTCAE bank, EORTC, EQ-5D, and Fatigue Severity Scale. We performed chart abstraction to assess extent of cancer burden, ECOG status, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), concurrent medical conditions, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) developing during or after treatment. For analysis, we dichotomized age (< 65 vs ≥65) and months from CI initiation (< 25 vs ≥25). Results: We enrolled 107 patients (39% survey response rate); 106 completed surveys. Participants were 57.0% male and 93.5% white, with median age 60.5 years (IQR: 51.1, 67.5 years). 79.4% had a CCI of 0 at start of CI; preexisting autoimmune disorders were rare. Median time since CI initiation was 36.4 months (range: 14.2, 133.9 months). Median length of CI treatment was 7.3 months (IQR: 2.1, 24.3 months); 15 patients were on treatment at the time of survey completion. Among those off treatment at the time of survey completion, median time off treatment was 27.1 months (IQR: 16.7, 40.4 months). The most common irAEs were rash (34.6%), colitis (24.3%), thyroiditis (19.6%), hepatitis (18.7%), and hypophysitis (13.1%). irAEs did not differ by age. Few patients reported symptoms at time of survey, most commonly aching joints (18%), fatigue (14%), aching muscles (13%), and difficulty sleeping (11%). Few (< 12%) had difficulty with physical, role, emotional, cognitive, or social functioning and almost none (1%) reported anxiety, depression or pain on the EQ-5D. QOL was excellent, with a median of 83.3% on the EQ-5D global health score and no differences based on toxicities or time from treatment. Conclusions: Long-term survivors of MMel patients report few burdensome symptoms after CI therapy and have excellent QOL."
