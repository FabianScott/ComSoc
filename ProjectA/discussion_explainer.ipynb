This makes a lot of sense as screen time together probably means interaction. The source from which we got the data is also inherently biased towards this type of interaction, as the nature of the movies means that sharing a scene correlates with having a meaningful relation."

With some groups mainly being dominated by military and hierarchical terms (the Empire), while others were dominated by more social and political terms (the Republic). The Jedi Order being very self-contained with terms related to their ideology etc. And the Rebels and the Resistance being very similar in their use of terms, with the Resistance including a lot of new names and words, because it is further ahead in time."
