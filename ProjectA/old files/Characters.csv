name,description
Admiral Raddus,"A gruff Mon Calamari officer, Raddus commands the rebel starfleet before the Battle of Yavin, working to knit a hodgepodge of ships into a military force and arrange the delivery of new capital ships to the Alliance. Raddus has little patience for the rebel council’s endless committee meetings. As he sees it, military muscle is the key to defeating the Empire, not stirring speeches."
Admiral Ozzel,"Admiral Ozzel commanded the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Darth Vader's mighty flagship and the linchpin of the squadron searching the galaxy for the Alliance's secret base. Ozzel led the initial attack on Hoth, but his choice of tactics infuriated Vader, leading to a sudden and permanent demotion."
'The Trickster' Flash Raktor,"Perhaps riot racer Flash Raktor gets his nickname, 'The Trickster,' from the dissonance of his programming and profession. Once a protocol droid, with databanks filled with languages and etiquette rules, Flash has been heavily modified to become a contender at the Safa Toma Speedway."
'Hyper' Rod,"In his specially-modified Seven Deuce Blaster, riot racer 'Hyper' Rod is a reprogrammed protocol droid who now focuses on the uncivilized task of eliminating his opponents at the Safa Toma Speedway."
'Quick-Draw' Quasar,"An amalgamation of droid parts, riot racer 'Quick-Draw' Quasar has the body of a protocol series droid and the head of a B1 battle bot. Painted with a splash of purple and yellow, he puts his strategic programming to work."
Albrekh,"An eccentric Sith alchemist and metalsmith known for a steady hand, Albrekh uses an ancient Sith forge to join the fragments of Kylo Ren’s shattered helmet with a glowing red lattice of Sarrassian iron."
Alton Kastle,"A journalist for HoloNet News, Alton Kastle was regarded by the Imperial citizens of Lothal as a trustworthy, even comforting source of information. Those in the know scoffed that Kastle's reports were Imperial propaganda -- their primary purpose was to maintain order in the name of the Empire, not to tell the truth or anything close to it."
Anakin Skywalker,"Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever. Some even believed he was the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. Always pushing the limits of his Jedi training, seeking to excel and live up to his reputation, Skywalker's passion often brought him into conflict with his mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. A hero of the Clone Wars, Anakin was caring and compassionate, but suffered from a deep fear of loss that would prove to be his downfall."
Appo,"A clone trooper in Republic service, Appo took part in a number of critical battles during the fight against the Separatists. As a sergeant, he served under General Pong Krell on Umbara, and saw firsthand Krell’s willingness to throw away the lives of his troops. In the final days of the war Appo accompanied Anakin Skywalker to Coruscant’s Jedi Temple as part of Order 66. When Senator Bail Organa arrived during the aftermath of the Temple attack, Appo told him of the “Jedi rebellion” and ordered him to leave the area."
Aurra Sing,"A feared bounty hunter known for her chalk-white skin and built-in comlink antenna, Aurra Sing was an expert sniper and trained assassin who would work for anyone who paid her. After the death of Jango Fett, Aurra trained Boba Fett as a bounty hunter, teaching him the skills -- and the ruthlessness -- that he would need in pursuing his deadly profession."
